<p class="caps"><span class="upper">"I don't</span> say that you fellows played the
part of cowards by firing into that unarmed
boat, but you acted like born idiots,
and it would serve you just right if the citizens
of Baton Rouge should come out here in
a body and lynch the last one of you. Why
do you not wait for orders from me instead of
roaming about the country acting on your own
responsibility? I know what the Confederacy
expects this company to do and you don't."</p>

<p>"Now jest listen at you, Tom Randolph."</p>

<p>"Yes, listen when your commanding officer
speaks, and remember that there is a handle
to my name and that I expect you to use it as
often as you address me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, <i>Cap'n</i> Randolph, if that suits you
any better; though it's mighty little you ever
done to deserve the title. When this company
of ourn was first got up didn't you say that
we was going to make all the Union men about
here hunt their holes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did; and I would have done it in
a soldier-like manner if you had obeyed my
orders, as you promised to do when you were
sworn into the service. But when you made
up your minds that you knew more than your
captain and set out to have your own way,
you got yourselves into hot water directly, and
I am very glad of it. If you have come to
your senses and will promise that from this
time on you will obey my orders to the letter,
and quit going off on raids unless I send you,
I will do the best I can for you; but the
minute you take the bits in your teeth, as you
have been doing for the last few months, that
minute I will throw you over and the conscript
officer can take you and welcome. And
mark my words, this is the last warning I
shall give you. The last one of you ought to
be court-martialled and shot."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>It was a motley group of men and boys,
perhaps a score of them in all, who were
gathered at the foot of the wide steps that led
up to the front door of Mr. Randolph's plantation
house, and one could have told at a
glance that they were as excited and angry as
was the young officer in Confederate uniform
on the gallery above, who shook his fists at
them over the railing, and addressed them in
the imperious language we have just recorded.
The most of the group were dressed like soldiers,
and that was what they claimed to be;
but whether they belonged to the Union or
Confederate army it would have been hard to
tell, for their clothing was an odd mixture of
the uniforms of both. It would have been
quite as hard to tell whether they belonged to
the artillery, infantry, or cavalry, for the distinguishing
colors of these three branches of
the service were about equally represented.
These men and boys called themselves Home
Guards; and they were members of the independent
company that Tom Randolph and his
father raised and equipped after Tom failed
to get himself elected second lieutenant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Captain Hubbard's Rangers. You remember
something about that, do you not?</p>

<p>When the war excitement was at its height
in the spring of 1861, and Rodney Gray, Marcy
Gray's cousin, left the military academy at
Barrington because he could not study while
others were going into the Southern army and
making ready to fight for the cause in which
they honestly believed, he was bound by a
compact he had made with some other red-hot
rebels in his class to enlist within twenty-four
hours after he reached home provided he could
get to a recruiting office in that time. The
uniform he wore at school was gray, and so
was the one adopted by those who were determined
to break up the government because
they could no longer do as they pleased with
it; and impulsive Rodney Gray, carried away
by the excitement of the hour, declared that
he would not wear any other color until the
South had gained her independence. He found
it easy to keep the first part of his promise,
for it so happened that he came home in time
to join an independent company of cavalry
that was being raised in his immediate neighborhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and which was intended to be so very
select that no applicant could get into the company
if a single member of it objected to him.</p>

<p>Among the prominent citizens of Mooreville
who took a deep interest in the organization
(they all claimed Mooreville as their home,
although some of them lived from three to a
dozen miles outside of it), and used both money
and influence to help it along, was Mr. Randolph,
Tom's father. If any young fellow who
stood well in the community hesitated to send
in his name because he could not raise money
enough to buy a horse and fit himself out as
well as the other Rangers were fitted out, Mr.
Randolph was prompt to come to his aid with
the assurance that if he would go ahead and
enlist, money need not stand in his way, for the
horse, uniform, weapons, and all other necessary
things would be forthcoming. He scoured
the country for miles around for recruits, and
did so much in other ways to aid the company
that when the Rangers made their first camp,
and hoisted above it the flag under which they
hoped to ride to victory, they named it Camp
Randolph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>This gentleman was so rabid a Secessionist
that he was utterly unreasonable. In fact, some
of his warmest friends declared that he was
about half crazy. He had no clearer conception
of the sufferings and trials that he and
those who believed as he did were bringing
upon the people of the South than the most
ignorant negro on his plantations. The men of
the North belonged to an inferior race and did
not know how to fight. They were going to be
whipped without any trouble at all, and when
the Southern troops had covered themselves
with glory by taking and holding Washington,
while Jefferson Davis dictated terms of peace
to the Lincoln hirelings, he wanted all the
Mooreville boys there to witness the grand and
imposing spectacle, and that was why he urged
them to enlist. That was about what Mr. Randolph
said, and no doubt he was honest with
himself as well as with the recruits he brought
into Captain Hubbard's company; but events
proved that he had another object in view and
one that he did not think it best to speak of.</p>

<p>Tom Randolph, who was twenty-four years
of age, was as conceited an ignoramus as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
was in that part of Louisiana; but he had an
idea that he was very bright, and capable of
filling any office he could get. At first he declared
his intention of going to the front as
captain of the Rangers. It would be no more
than right that he should have the highest
place in return for what his father had done
for the company; but when Mr. Randolph told
him that <i>that</i> would be aiming a little too high,
that Bob Hubbard, who had really done more
hard work for the company than anybody else,
would certainly be chosen captain, and that it
would look better and be better if Tom would
accept something a little lower down and work
his way up, the young man decided that he
would be a candidate for the second lieutenant's
place. He was sure he would get it and
so was his father; but he didn't. Although
the Rangers <i>did</i> not know anything about soldiering,
they did know what sort of men they
wanted for officers, and Tom received but
twelve votes out of sixty-five&mdash;his own and
those of the eleven recruits his father had
brought into the company. Then there was
trouble in the camp, and if Tom and his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
had possessed the physical power they would
have thrashed every Ranger in it. But there
was one thing about it: if they could not have
a voice in the management of the company they
would not only cease to support it, but would
do their best to break it up; and Tom acted
upon this rule or ruin policy by withdrawing
from the ranks almost as soon as the result of
the ballot was announced, his example being
followed by the eleven recruits who had voted
for him.</p>

<p>"Now let's see how they will get on with
their Partisan Rangers," Tom said to his
father that night. "There's almost too much
social equality in that company anyway to
suit me. I have noticed it ever since I have
been in it. Who is their second lieutenant,
the man they shoved into my place? A common
book-keeper who never in his life had the
price of a pickaninny in his pocket."</p>

<p>Tom hoped and believed that by withdrawing
from the company he had inflicted a blow
upon it from which it would never recover;
but to his surprise and disgust the Rangers
went ahead with their plans as if nothing had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
happened. Rodney Gray, the only member of
the organization who knew anything about
military matters, was made first duty sergeant
and drill-master; and under his skillful management
the Rangers changed so rapidly from
awkward greenhorns to soldiers, and became
so proficient in the school of the company,
that the deserters, with the single exception
of Tom Randolph himself, began to repent
their hasty action, and ask one another what
they could do to induce the Rangers to take
them back again. They knew they could not
look to Mr. Randolph for an outfit, for he took
Tom's defeat as a deliberate insult to his
family, and instead of promoting enlistments
in the company was doing all he could to stop
them. The only one they could turn to for
help was Rodney Gray's father&mdash;a man who
had said and done nothing of consequence to
show that he was in favor of partisan organizations,
and who was looked upon with suspicion
by his neighbors because he put no faith in
the final success of the secession movement,
and did not hesitate to say that the South
would be whipped as she deserved to be for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
trying to break up the government. There
were thousands of wealthy and influential men
in Louisiana who believed as he did; and yet
they did more to help the soldiers than the
blatant rebels who were fierce for a fight at
the beginning, but went over to the Federals at
the first opportunity, and became "spies and
informers for the sake of the loaves and fishes
that fell into their hands." The sequel proved
that the recruits went to the right man, for six
of the eleven were fitted out at Mr. Gray's expense.
And he did not boast of it either, as
Mr. Randolph and Tom had done.</p>

<p>Captain Hubbard's Rangers, as the company
was always called, got on very well until they
began looking around for someone to swear
them into the service and order them to the
front, and then the trouble began. They first
applied to the commanding officer at New Orleans;
but he declined to have anything to do
with them unless they would give up their independent
organization, and that was something
the Rangers were determined they would
not do to please anybody. They formed their
company in the first place because they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
led to believe that the Richmond government
was in full sympathy with such organizations,
which would be allowed full liberty of action
when sworn into the service of the State; but
such would by no means be the case if they
permitted themselves to be sworn into the
service of the Confederacy. As one of the
Rangers expressed it: "If they were going to
give their liberty up to a new government
they might as well have stayed under the
old."</p>

<p>Tom Randolph was delighted when he heard
of this state of affairs, and the Rangers themselves
were much depressed; but Rodney Gray
was sure he saw a way out of the difficulty
when he received a letter from his old schoolmate
and chum, Dick Graham, who lived in
Missouri. In that letter Dick said he belonged
to an organization of partisans who
were known as State Guards. Their immediate
commander was General Price, but they were
required to take oath to obey Governor
Jackson and nobody else. In plain English
this meant that while the State Guards were
willing to look out for the secession movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
in Missouri and keep all Yankee invaders off
her soil, they did not intend to go into any
other State unless they felt like it, or permit
the Richmond authorities to control their
movements in any way. That was exactly the
kind of partisans that Captain Hubbard and
his men wanted to be; and when Rodney
Gray said that if the Governor of their own
State would not accept them as a company,
they had a perfect right to offer themselves to
the Governor of another, and that it might be
a good plan to ask General Price if he would
take the Rangers just as they were, Captain
Hubbard was glad to act upon the suggestion.
So, without delay, a telegram was sent to
Dick Graham's father in St. Louis, and in due
time the answer came back:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Price will accept. Company officers and independent
organization to remain the same.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>To quote from Rodney, this brought the
matter squarely home to the Rangers, who
were compelled to decide upon some course of
action without loss of time. A business meeting
of the company (and a stormy one it turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
out to be) was held that very day; and
although Captain Hubbard and Rodney carried
their point, it was only by a small
majority of votes that the Rangers consented
to leave their own State and go into the service
of another.</p>

<p>Believing it to be a good plan to strike while
the iron was hot, Captain Hubbard and one of
his officers at once set out for New Orleans to
find a boat that would take the company to
Little Rock; but in the meantime the Governor
of Louisiana got wind of the affair
through spies in the telegraph office in Mooreville,
and tried to upset the designs of the
Rangers by having them sworn in by General
Lacey, who was a Confederate officer. He
would have succeeded too had it not been
for quick-witted Rodney Gray, who cautioned
his comrades not to answer to their names
when the roll was called. He did more.
When his own name was called he rode to
the front and centre and surprised and angered
the general, a veteran of the Mexican
War, who had never learned to recognize any
organizations outside of those mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the Army Regulations, by stating that the
company was an independent one whose members,
while willing and eager to be sworn into
the service of their State, did not desire to
enter the service of the Confederate States.
They enlisted as partisans, and partisans
they wished to remain. Upon hearing this
the veteran was astounded. He declared, by
the shade of the great and good Washington,
that he did not know what the country was
coming to, flung the roll-book on the ground
at the feet of Rodney's horse, and rode away
in a huff; and that was the last of Captain
Hubbard's Rangers. They broke ranks then
and there and never held a company meeting
afterward.</p>

<p>The next morning Rodney Gray, who was
determined to be a partisan and nothing else,
started for Missouri with no companion but his
horse, and eventually succeeded in finding his
friend Graham in spite of all the efforts that
were made, both by Union men and rebels, to
stop him. Of course Tom Randolph was happy
over the way things had turned out, and one
would think he ought to have been satisfied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
but he was not. Every one of the Rangers who
voted against him when he ran for second lieutenant
made an enemy of Tom, and he showed
it as often as the opportunity was presented.
He felt particularly spiteful toward Rodney
Gray, whose services as drill-master had been
publicly acknowledged by the gift of an elegant
sword from the company, and he began persecuting
him the moment he learned that Rodney
had decided to leave the State and go to Missouri.
With the aid of a friend of his, Drummond
by name, who had charge of the telegraph
office in Mooreville, he paved the way
for Rodney's arrest in St. Louis by sending a
description of him and his horse to Mr. Randolph's
agent, a Yankee cotton factor, who
lived in that city; but this scheme, which
might have brought Rodney's soldiering to an
end before it was fairly begun, was frustrated
by a "student" in Drummond's office whose
name was Griffin, and who went all the way to
Baton Rouge by night to warn Rodney of the
plots that had been laid against him. Acting
on his friendly hints Rodney did not go to St.
Louis as he had intended, but left the boat at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Cedar Bluff Landing in Missouri; and from
there, after some exciting experiences with a
squad of emergency men who happened to
come in with a prisoner during the night, he
set off across the country to find General Price
and Dick Graham.</p>

<p>He had undertaken something from which
the boldest man might have shrunk without
any fear of being accused of timidity; but he
came through with flying colors as we have
said, did a soldier's duty side by side with his
friend Dick for fifteen dreary months, was discharged
with him at Tupelo after the evacuation
of Corinth, and brought Dick home with
him to his father's house at Mooreville, where
they were both resting at the time this story
begins. Even after they were discharged, and
had begun telling each other that their troubles
and trials as soldiers were all over, they met
with an adventure that under almost any other
circumstances might have proved a serious
thing for them. Shortly after they left Camp
Pinckney on their way home, they ran into a
squad of Union troopers, who covered them with
their carbines and told them to come in out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the rain. They were prisoners for the first
time, but did not remain so any longer than
it took their captors to read their discharges.
The boys' hearts overflowed with gratitude
when the good-natured corporal who commanded
the squad jerked his thumb over his
shoulder and told them to "git," and Rodney
hinted that the time might come when they
could repay his kindness. Strange as it may
appear the time did come, and perhaps we
shall see if Rodney remembered and kept his
promise.</p>

<p>Rodney Gray was the only one of Captain
Hubbard's Rangers who became a partisan.
The Governor's attempt to have them sworn
into the Confederate service against their will
broke them up completely, and so disgusted
some of their number that they declared they
never wanted to see a man with a star on his
collar again; but they could not remain at
home while all their friends were making haste
to go to the front for fear that the fun would
all be over and the Yankees whipped before
they could get there, and in the end every one
of them became what he repeatedly declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
he never would be&mdash;a Confederate soldier.
Then it was that Tom Randolph and his father
began to bestir themselves. There was a good
deal of pressure brought to bear upon every
young man and boy in the South about that
time, and those who would not put on a gray
jacket or do something else to show their zeal
for the cause were coldly treated and sometimes
snubbed; but Tom Randolph escaped all
this, and even raised himself higher in the estimation
of some of the Mooreville people by
procuring, through his father's influence, a
captain's commission in the State militia, with
authority to recruit a company of mounted
men who were to act as Home Guards. Tom
knew the commission was coming and prepared
for it by ordering a fine uniform and horse
equipments of the latest and most expensive
pattern, not forgetting an officer's sword which
on its scabbard bore an inscription to the effect
that the weapon was presented by his affectionate
relatives, and on the blade the old
Spanish legend:</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Draw me not without a cause,</div>
<div class="i0">Nor sheath me with dishonor.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>
<p>"That is a good motto, my son," said Mr.
Randolph, when Tom drew the weapon and
proudly showed it as though his father had
never seen it before, "and I trust you will
bear it constantly in mind."</p>

<p>"The cause of the South is a righteous cause,
for it is the cause of freedom the world over,"
shouted Captain Randolph, pounding the table
with his fist and ignoring the fact that his father
held more than four hundred men, women, and
children in bondage at that moment. "To
cease fighting for that cause at the bidding of
the tyrant Lincoln would be dishonor; and
the stain upon our record as a nation would
be so deep and black that it <i>never</i> could be
wiped out. When once I have drawn this
beautiful sword in defence of the <i>rights</i> of
my country, it shall never be sheathed until
every Yankee south of Mason and Dixon's
line has been driven back where he belongs."</p>

<p>The eloquent soldier pounded the table with
his fist; everyone in the room, negro servants
and all, applauded; and one of the latter ventured
to say, in tones that of course were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
intended to reach the officer's ears: "Say, you
niggahs! What'll you bet dem Yankees don't
run fit to kill derselves when dey see Mass'
Tom comin'?" As to Tom, he smiled complacently
and said to himself: "That was a
better speech than Rodney Gray delivered
when those Rangers gave him that frog-sticker
of his."</p>

<p>Knowing Rodney Gray and Dick Graham
as well as you ought to know them by this
time, what do you think they would have
thought if they had been in that room and
listened to Tom's words? Before twenty
minutes had passed away he appeared upon
the streets of Mooreville in the full glory
of his captain's suit and with his horse
duly caparisoned; but having no company
to command he prudently left his sword at
home.</p>

<p>It was Tom's wish and his father's to bring
the strength of the company up to a hundred
men; but Tom found it harder work to raise a
small fraction of that number than it was to
get his commission from the Governor. Everyone
who presented himself was accepted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
that too without reference to his social standing
or his ability to pass the surgeon; and
when all other expedients to promote enlistments
had been tried, Mr. Randolph came to
the front, as he had done in the case of the
Rangers, with the offer to arm and equip all
recruits who could not furnish their own outfit.
This helped matters along amazingly;
and when fifty men had been enrolled Captain
Randolph ordered them to appear in one
of his father's fields on a certain afternoon,
armed and equipped as the law directed,
for "company inspection." No one knew
just what the order meant, but the men were
all in the field at the appointed time; and
when Tom came to look at them as they sat
in their saddles facing him, after making an
awkward and ineffectual effort to fall in line,
he was disgusted with them and with himself
too. Until that moment he had no idea that
he had been enrolling so unpromising a body
of men. <i>Men!</i> They looked more like lazy
vagabonds, as indeed the most of them were.
Rodney Gray himself could not have made
soldiers of them. The next half hour was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
ordeal that Captain Tom never wanted to pass
through again; but we will let him describe it
in his own way.</p>

<p>"They were the worst looking fellows I
think I ever saw," Tom told his father and
mother when he reached home after the "inspection"
was over. "I brought them together
because I wanted to see how they
looked, and how I would look riding at their
head; and to tell the honest truth, if a stranger
had come into that field when they first tried
to draw themselves up in line I believe I
should have put spurs to my horse and
galloped away rather than be seen in their
company."</p>

<p>"Why, what was the matter with them?"
inquired his mother, who took as deep an interest
in the organization as Tom himself, and
was anxious that it should win a name for him
after the rebuff he had received at the hands
of Captain Hubbard's Rangers. "You knew
they were not gentlemen when you asked
them to give in their names. There are few of
that sort left in the country, more's the pity."</p>

<p>"I know that; but I hoped they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
have pride enough to make a half-way respectable
appearance at inspection," answered Captain
Tom. "In the first place, no two of them
were mounted, armed, or dressed alike. In
the next, they came just as they had been at
work in the field in the forenoon, and I don't
believe that half of them had taken the trouble
to wash their faces or comb their hair."</p>

<p>"They looked just as we see them on the
streets every day, I suppose," said Mr. Randolph.</p>

<p>"Just the same, only worse," replied Tom,
who was almost mad enough to cry every time
he thought of it. "Here was a man mounted on
the heaviest kind of a plough horse and carrying
a long squirrel rifle on his shoulder, and
beside him was one on a little runt of a mule
and armed with a heavy double-barrel deer-killer.
Not a few of them had chicken or
turkey feathers stuck in their slouch hats for
plumes, and some had pipes in their mouths;
and when I said that no smoking would be
allowed in the ranks, they did not hesitate
to tell me that I need not think I could boss
them around as Rodney Gray had bossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Rangers while he was acting as their drill-master,
for that was something they would
not submit to."</p>

<p>"Why the&mdash;the impudence!" exclaimed
Mrs. Randolph; while her husband looked
down at the floor and told himself that that
was about what might have been expected
of such men as he and Tom had been able to
bring into the Home Guards.</p>

<p>"That's the kind of soldiers they are," continued
Captain Tom. "They know I haven't
the power to enforce my commands, and so
they intend to do pretty near as they please.
The only reason they joined was because they
wanted an excuse for keeping out of the army,
and get the horses and weapons that were
promised them."</p>

<p>"And food," added Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"Food!" exclaimed her husband. "I
didn't promise them any food except in case
they were ordered to some other part of the
State, and then I said I would look out for the
families of those who were too poor to make
provision for them."</p>

<p>"Well, a rough looking fellow who said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
was a member of the company came to the
kitchen yesterday and asked for some bacon
on the strength of that promise, and I gave it
to him," said Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"I'll bet he played a game on you," said
Captain Tom.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty state of affairs!" exclaimed
the father, profoundly astonished. "Don't
give another mouthful to him or anybody else
on the strength of promises I made to that
company. As long as they stay about here
they will earn their own food or go hungry."</p>

<p>"That's the kind of soldiers they are," repeated
Tom. "They enlisted because they
are afraid to go into the army and too lazy
to work, and not because they care a picayune
for the Confederacy. And after I had brought
them in line as well as I could, and told one
man to take his pants out of his boots and be
sure that those boots were blacked the next
time he came out to inspection, and ordered
another to put his hat on straight and quit
carrying his gun flat on his shoulder as he
would if he were hog hunting in the woods,
they made up their minds that they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
elect officers. When I told them that I hadn't
brought them together for any such purpose,
and that we would postpone the matter until
the company had been brought up to its full
strength, they didn't pay the least attention
to me."</p>

<p>"It's a rabble&mdash;a mob and nothing else,"
cried Mrs. Randolph, who looked as angry as
her son felt. "It is the one wish of my heart
to see you take a proud position among the
noble defenders of your country, but you will
never have anything more to do with those
ruffians with my consent. Whom did they
choose for officers?"</p>

<p>Tom mentioned the names of two of the
meanest men in the country for miles around,
and his angry mother continued:</p>

<p>"A common overseer and an acknowledged
chicken and hog thief! My son, you must not
appear again in the company of those men."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to," replied Tom, jumping
to his feet and striding up and down the room.
"Although I despise every man in Captain
Hubbard's company, and have ever since they
defeated me for the second lieutenancy, I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
acknowledge that they were a fine looking
body of men, and I somehow got it into my
head that my Home Guards would look and
act just like them; but they don't, and I am
so disappointed that I don't see how I can
ever get over it. I'll hold fast to my commission
and rank, but I'll have nothing more
to do with that company of Home Guards."</p>

<p>Slowly and sadly Captain Tom ascended to
his room, where he took off his fine uniform
and arrayed himself in the citizen's suit he
had vowed never to put on again until he
had helped the South gain her independence.
Then he put his handsome sword into its cloth
case, stood it up in the darkest corner of his
closet, and closed the door. He felt like a
monarch who had lost his crown.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">CAPTAIN TOM SMELLS POWDER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">For</span> a long time Captain Randolph remained
firm in his resolution to have
nothing more to do with the Home Guards.
Although he did not formally throw up his
command of the company he kept away from it
as much as he could, and never ordered it to appear
for drills and inspections; but by so doing
he did not by any means escape being taken to
task for the lawless acts of which his men were
guilty. The company well deserved the name
that Mrs. Randolph had applied to it, and one
could not reasonably expect that they would
conduct themselves as the high-toned Mooreville
Rangers would have done under the same
circumstances. It had never occurred to them
to inquire what their duties would be when
they were sworn into the service of the State,
and it is extremely doubtful if their captain
could have enlightened them on that point;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
but in their ignorance they took it for granted
that they had been given liberty to do as they
pleased, and acting under the leadership of
their lieutenants, Lambert, the overseer, and
Moseley, the chicken and hog thief, they very
soon made themselves known to and feared
and hated by the citizens for miles around.
Tom heard of their exploits now and then,
and although he stamped his feet and shook
his clenched hands in the air, he did nothing to
show his authority. At last things came to
such a pass that Captain Tom, to quote from
Rodney's friend Griffin, who was closely
watching the movements of the Home Guards,
"had to fish or cut bait."</p>

<p>Bright and early one morning a couple of
angry planters galloped furiously into Mr.
Randolph's front yard, threw themselves from
their horses, leaving the animals to tramp
down the flower beds or stand still as they
pleased, entered the house without knocking,
and made their way through the hall into the
dining room, where the family sat at breakfast.
Without giving anybody time to express surprise
at their abrupt entrance or to inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
into the nature of their business, they stalked
around the table to the chair in which Tom
was sitting and shook their fists in his face
pretty close to his nose.</p>

<p>"Look-a-here, young feller," said the one
whose rage would permit him to speak first,
"what do you mean by sending them vagabonds
of yourn, them Home Guards, into
gentlemen's houses to turn things up topsy-turvy?"</p>

<p>The men looked so dangerous that Captain
Tom turned white with alarm, but could not
utter a word. He understood the charge and
knew he was innocent, but he could not say
so.</p>

<p>"When that company of yourn was first got
together you took pains to spread it around
that you were going to use them to clean out
the Union men," the planter almost shouted.
"That was all right and I didn't have a word
to say against it, for I thought they oughter
be driven out; but why don't you confine yourselves
to searching the houses of Union men,
and let good and loyal Confederates like me
and my neighbor alone? We are as strong for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the South and as ready to fight for her as you
are; and I tell you once for all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>By this time Tom's father and mother had
recovered themselves in some measure, but
Tom himself was still so frightened that he
could not speak. The former arose and
placed chairs for the visitors, and Mrs. Randolph
told the girl to lay plates for them, adding
that if they would sit down and tell their
story while drinking a cup of coffee, she was
sure her son could clear himself of the serious
accusations they had brought against him.
If their houses had been raided by the Home
Guards they might rest assured that a Randolph
was in no way to blame for it. This
calmed the storm and made the visitors look
as though they felt a little ashamed of themselves;
but they sat down and told their
story.</p>

<p>"It seems that that man Lambert, who
always was too lazy and trifling to earn an
honest living, has give up his situation as overseer
on Miss Randall's place, and took to raiding
through the country on his own hook,"
said the planter who had thus far done all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
talking. "We have heard of him a time or
two, but so long as he stole from Union men
and pestered them it was all right; but last
night he jumped down on me and Boswell, and
that is a little more than we can stand."</p>

<p>"I don't see what made him do that," exclaimed
Tom, who had by this time found his
tongue. "He knows you are good Confederates."</p>

<p>"Of course he knows it, and when we reminded
him of it he didn't try to deny it;
but he allowed we had guns in the house, and
that them dangerous things couldn't be permitted
to stay in the country except in the
hands of soldiers. So he came to our houses
and searched them; and as he had about a
dozen men in his gang we couldn't help ourselves."</p>

<p>"As sure as I live I never gave him orders
to search anybody's premises," declared Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't reckon you ever gave him much
orders of any sort," replied the planter, with
a look on his face which showed that he knew
about how much authority Tom had over the
Home Guards.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"And bear this in mind," added his companion:
"when we found that we couldn't
say or do anything to stop them, and that
they were dead set on having the guns, we
offered to bring 'em out ruther than have them
dirty vagabonds rummaging over our things;
but that didn't by no means suit Lambert.
Him and his men must go in themselves so as
to be sure of getting everything in the shape
of weapons there was. And when they got
into my house where do you suppose was the
first place they went to?" added Boswell, with
suppressed fury.</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest idea," replied Mrs.
Randolph, when the man stopped and looked
around as if he expected an answer.</p>

<p>"To the bed," said Tom, who had heard
that it was a good plan for raiders to look
between mattresses for things they wanted to
find.</p>

<p>"No, they didn't. They went straight to
my wife's bureau," said Boswell fiercely.
"That was a pretty place to look for guns,
wasn't it, now?"</p>

<p>Tom was thunderstruck. He knew that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Home Guards had been denounced as robbers
because they had ransacked the dwellings and
smoke-houses of Union men, and had thought
nothing of it, for Union men had no rights,
and were not in the least deserving of sympathy;
but this was a different matter altogether.
It would never do to let such a story
as that get to the ears of the Governor.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they looked into the bureau for
revolvers," he managed to say at length.</p>

<p>"No, they didn't. They looked for rings
and breastpins and bracelets and the like;
but they didn't find none, for my wife was
sharp enough to put the whole business into
her pocket as soon as she see that they were
set on coming into the house. All the same,
they got a rifle that cost me $125 in gold in
New Orleans in good times, and a shot gun
that is worth almost twice as much. And
I'll tell you what's a fact, Tom Randolph:
I want them guns back. They're mine, and if
I don't get 'em I'll raise a fuss."</p>

<p>"And while you are getting them you might
as well tell Lambert to hand over the two guns
he stole from me," said the other visitor, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that if he ever pokes his long nose inside my
door again I'll send the contents of one of 'em
into it. I say nothing about the hams they
took from my smoke house, but they mustn't
try to take any more. I reckon me and Boswell
were a little too fast in accusing you of
sending Lambert to search our houses, but you
being the captain, you know, why&mdash;really you
had oughter make them fellers go a little
slower. What do you think of the situation
anyhow, Mr. Randolph? And how long will
it be before we shall have Washington?"</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph and his wife were glad to
have the conversation turned into another
channel, and so was Captain Tom, who did not
want to hear any more about Lieutenant Lambert
and his exploits. He was ill at ease as
long as the visitors remained; but they went
away as soon as they had drunk their coffee,
and seemed as glad to go as the Randolphs
were to have them.</p>

<p>Tom did not eat a hearty breakfast that
morning, for the fear that the Governor might
get wind of Lambert's latest raid and revoke
his commission, added to the difficulties he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
saw in his way of complying with the demands
his late visitors had made upon him, took
away his appetite. He must restore those
guns to their owners&mdash;there were no two ways
about that; but how should he go to work to
get them? His first thought was to present
himself before Lambert in full uniform and, by
virtue of the authority conferred upon him by
his captain's commission, which stated in plain
language that he was to be obeyed by all persons
under him, demand the return of the
stolen property forthwith. That was the way
any other captain would have gone about it,
Tom thought; but he was afraid that bluster
might not prove successful in his case. He had
reason to fear (and it was one of the heaviest
trials he was called upon to bear) that he did not
stand as high in the estimation of some of his
men as he did in his mother's; that he had on
one or two occasions been compared to a wagon's
fifth wheel in point of usefulness, and it would
be just like the insubordinate Lambert to refuse
point blank to obey his orders. That
would be unfortunate, for it would show to the
world, and perhaps to the Governor, that Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
was not the real captain of the Home Guards.
After looking at the matter from all sides he
made up his mind that conciliation would be
his best policy, and when he rode away to
seek an interview with his lieutenant he wore
citizen's clothes and left his sword behind. He
found Lambert at his quarters on the Randall
plantation, where he continued to live,
although he had turned the work over to the
field hands and seldom took the trouble to
see how it was going on, and he was just getting
ready to mount the horse that had been
brought to his door.</p>

<p>"Hallo, lieutenant!" began Tom, with
more familiarity and good-fellowship than he
had ever before exhibited in addressing the
man.</p>

<p>"Morning, cap'n," replied the overseer,
who might have responded to the salutation
in a very different way if Tom had not been
respectful enough to put a handle to his name.
"Want to see me?"</p>

<p>"I came over on purpose to have a friendly
talk with you," said Tom. "Look here, old
fellow; you will play smash if you don't stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
raiding the premises of such men as Boswell
and Wallace. What induced you to do it?"</p>

<p>"Aint I got a right to look for we'pons?"
demanded Lambert.</p>

<p>"You have authority from me," answered
Tom, with some emphasis on the two last
words, "to search the houses of Union men,
but you have no right to enter the dwellings
of Confederates."</p>

<p>"Look-a-here, cap'n. I knowed that them
two men had guns in hiding."</p>

<p>"But you didn't expect to find them in
bureau drawers, did you?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed the overseer. He looked
somewhat abashed for a moment and then
continued: "When I search a house I search
it. I look into every hole and corner in it."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly right when you search
houses belonging to the enemies of your country;
but it is all wrong when you enter the
houses of our friends. Such work will turn
them against us&mdash;make enemies of them. I
saw Boswell and Wallace this morning and
they are mad as hornets. They want their
guns back."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, the next time you see 'em just ask
if they'll have 'em now or wait till they get
'em. I want them guns myself to keep the
Yankees from getting 'em."</p>

<p>"The Yankees!" said Tom contemptuously.
"You don't think they will ever get
this far South, do you?"</p>

<p>"They mout. Didn't you say yourself that
they was liable to come down from Cairo or up
from New Orleans, and that we'd oughter have
a company of Home Guards here to stop 'em?"</p>

<p>"I said there was a bare possibility that
they might do so, and that it would be the
part of wisdom to prepare for an emergency,"
answered Captain Tom, who well remembered
that he had used stronger language than that
while urging Lambert to send in his name.
"But I want those guns and must have them
at once. You haven't any commission from
the Governor yet, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Tom said this he stopped abruptly
and gave such a start that his lieutenant looked
up at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, cap'n?" said he.
"You what?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't received your commission
from the Governor yet," repeated Tom slowly
and emphatically. "And when I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I got to have a paper like yourn?"
exclaimed Lambert, looking astonished and
interested. "That's news to me."</p>

<p>"Yes. And it can come to you only through
my recommendation. I must certify that you
were legally elected to the office you hold, and
that was the reason I did not want you men to
go through the farce of holding an election on
horseback on the day I ordered you out for inspection,"
replied Tom; but the truth was he
had never thought of it until that moment.
It was a bright idea that suddenly flitted
through his mind, and he wondered why it had
been so long in coming to him.</p>

<p>"Well, by gum!" was all the disgusted
Lambert could say in reply.</p>

<p>"Your papers, if you get them, will be
something like mine, only different, you know,
for a captain outranks a lieutenant by a large
majority," continued Tom, improving to the
utmost the advantage he had so unexpectedly
gained. "You have no authority to make out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
warrants, but I have; and our non-coms., if
we had any, would have to look to me for
them."</p>

<p>This was all Greek to the overseer, who had
taken no pains to post himself on military
matters, but he did not ask Tom to explain,
for he was anxious to hear more about the
commission he ought to have, but had not yet
received.</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said he impatiently. "And
when you what?"</p>

<p>"And when I make my first report to the
Governor or his adjutant-general, and ask him
about your commission and Moseley's, I want
to be able to say that you are in every way
satisfactory to me as well as to the people
hereabouts, and that I am sure you will make
brave and obedient officers. But you can see
for yourself that I can't say that if you keep
on bothering good and loyal Confederates like
Wallace and Boswell. I think you had better
give me those guns."</p>

<p>"I aint got but one," replied Lambert, who
seemed to have lost the independent and swaggering
air he had assumed at the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the interview, "and I'll go right in and bring
it out."</p>

<p>"Where are the others?" demanded Captain
Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, Moseley's got one, Smith's got
another, and where t'other one has went I disremember
just at this minute."</p>

<p>"You distributed the spoils among you, it
seems."</p>

<p>"Yes, kinder; so't the Yankees couldn't
easy find them."</p>

<p>"Then you must ride around and gather
them up; and as I have nothing particular
to do this morning I will go with you. I'd
rather be a king among hogs than a hog
among kings any day," said Tom to himself,
as his lieutenant turned about and went into
his house, "but I confess I little thought I
should get so low down as to command a
lot of brigands. That idea about the commissions
makes me the biggest toad in the
puddle from this time on. I'll hold them
up as prospective rewards for good behavior
and prompt obedience of orders; but
Lambert and Moseley shall never have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
commissions on my recommendation, I bet
you."</p>

<p>The Home Guards had deliberately stolen
these four valuable guns, and Tom Randolph
knew it as soon as he found how they had
been scattered about. The plea that if permitted
to remain in possession of their owners
they might be captured by the Yankees, who
would use them to kill Confederates, was Lambert's
excuse for one of the worst outrages
that had ever been perpetrated in that part of
Louisiana; but it was by no means the last.
Three-fourths of all the Home Guards in the
South were like Captain Tom's men, and the
worst that can be said of them is that they
acted as guards at Andersonville, Libby, Millen,
and Salisbury. It was not the Confederate
soldiers who served at the front, but the Home
Guards, who starved the boys in blue to death
in those prison pens, and hunted them with
bloodhounds when they escaped.</p>

<p>The upshot of the whole matter was that
Tom got the guns, which in due time were restored
to their lawful owners, and plumed
himself on having firmly established his authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
over his men. Well, they did behave
a little better during the daytime and in that
settlement where they were so well known,
but they took to riding around of nights, and
making "visits of ceremony" to isolated farmhouses
in which they had reason to suppose
that they would find something worth stealing.
But riding was anything but easy work, and
the novelty of frightening women and children
and browbeating unarmed men wore off after
a while; and when they had secured bacon
and meal enough to last them for a few weeks,
the Home Guards subsided and were seldom
heard of again until the news of the glorious
victory at Bull Run raised the war spirit of
the Southern people to the old fever heat.
Then they came to the surface again, and persecuted
Union people in and around Mooreville
so fiercely that some of them were compelled
to flee for their lives, Captain Randolph
being in command this time. From his friend
Drummond, the telegraph operator, he secured
a list of all suspected persons in the neighborhood,
and with this to aid him Tom succeeded
in doing effective work for the cause of Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
independence. But it was too much like
labor to be kept up for any length of time;
there was not very much glory in it anyway
the better class of Secessionists in the community
became strongly opposed to it, and so the
Home Guards dropped out of sight once more,
not to appear again until Farragut captured
New Orleans and sent some of his vessels up
the river to effect a junction with Flag-Officer
Davis at Vicksburg. When the people of
Mooreville heard of it they were very indignant,
and some of them declared that they
would never submit to have their country
overrun in that way&mdash;they would die first;
and to show how very much in earnest they
were they stopped all work, shut up their
houses, and ran about the streets in the greatest
excitement. When the ship of war <i>Iroquois</i>
came up with Commander Palmer on board
and demanded the surrender of Baton Rouge,
the mayor of that insignificant little town
"indulged in the same mock-heroic nonsense
that the mayor and council of New Orleans
had been indulging in the week before." He
declared that the city would not be surrendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
to any power on earth, and that if the
Federals took possession of it they would do
it without the consent and against the wishes
of the peaceable inhabitants.</p>

<p>"It was all done for effect, and that man
will be one of the last in the Confederacy to
shoulder a musket," said Rodney Gray when
he heard of it; but being a soldier he applauded
the action of Captain Palmer, who,
without any fuss or parade, promptly took
possession of the barracks, arsenal, and other
property of the United States. He hoisted the
flag of the Union over the arsenal too, and told
the boastful mayor in pretty plain language
that he would let it stay there if he did not
want to get himself and his town into trouble.</p>

<p>"All honor to the brave citizens of New
Orleans. They have shown me how I ought
to act in this emergency," said Captain Randolph
on the morning the startling news came
that some of the victorious Union fleet had
steamed up the river. He posted for his room
the moment he heard of it, and when he came
down he was dressed in his uniform and wore
his glittering sword by his side.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Now take those things off and don't make
a fool of yourself," said Mr. Randolph, who
had told his wife over and over again that
from the bottom of his heart he wished he
had never had anything to do with the Home
Guards.</p>

<p>"Don't be rash, my dear," said his mother
in tones more befitting the occasion. "What
are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I shall assemble my company and place
myself in a strong position between here and
Baton Rouge, and stand ready to resist the
enemy's advance upon Mooreville," replied
Tom. "The Federal General Butler has
more than 100,000 men, and can easily spare
some of them long enough to make our
capital a heap of ashes; but the Governor
shall hear that I harassed them while they
were doing it, as our own Marion and his bold
men used to harass the Redcoats."</p>

<p>Those who were best acquainted with Tom
Randolph knew that he would not have gone
one step toward Baton Rouge if he had not
had the best of reasons for believing that there
were no troops at hand to take possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the city after the war ships had captured it;
but although Tom hinted as much to the
members of his company whom he tried to
rally to the defence of their hearth-stones, he
could not induce more than a handful of them
to turn out. It did not require very much
courage to rob Union men who had previously
been deprived of their weapons, but facing
blue-jackets who were likely to have loaded muskets
in their hands was a more serious matter.
The excuses the Home Guards made for refusing
to follow their captain were of the flimsiest
kind; but, all the same, they wouldn't go, and
Tom finally rode away with only a baker's
dozen of men at his heels. They arrived within
sight of the spires of the city on the same
day that Captain Palmer's sailors hoisted the
Union flag over the arsenal, and might perhaps
have witnessed the ceremony if they had
gone a mile or two farther down the road;
but Captain Tom could not uncover Mooreville
even for the sake of saving the capital of his
State. He did not even venture near enough
to the Mississippi to see the <i>Iroquois'</i> topmasts;
but he went closer to the enemy than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the cowards who remained at home, and that
was something to be proud of.</p>

<p>Captain Tom slept in a planter's house that
night, while his men bunked in the stables and
corn cribs and under the trees in the yard, and
the next morning made a wide detour to the
river above the city with no other object in
view than to be able to say, when he went
home, that he had been there. If he had
known what he was going to see and experience
when he reached the river it isn't likely
that he would have gone in that direction at
all; for he halted his men behind the levee
just in time to see a monster war vessel steaming
leisurely up the swift, muddy current of
the Mississippi. She was the blackest, ugliest
looking thing that Tom's eyes had ever rested
on, and the queerest sensations came over him
as he gazed at her. It was not a cold day, but
Tom shivered violently, and tasted something
in his mouth that reminded him of salt.</p>

<p>"By gum! There's one of them things
now. Let's try a whack at her. What do you
say, boys?"</p>

<p>Tom had been on the point of giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
signal for retreat, or trying to give it, but this
astounding and reckless proposition staggered
him so that he could not open his mouth.
The man who made it showed that he was in
earnest by swinging himself from his horse
and advancing on all fours toward the levee,
dragging his rifle along the ground at his side.
In less time than it takes to tell it he and all
his companions were lying prone behind the
levee, using it as a breastwork, and Captain
Tom sat in his saddle looking on like one in a
dream. When they were all in position one
of the Home Guards set up a warwhoop, a
straggling fire ran along the top of the levee
and bullets and buckshot went whistling
toward the vessel. There were several men on
her deck and around the wheel-house, and
although Tom did not see any of them fall he
did see that they were badly frightened, for
they ran in all directions, and an instant later
there was not one of them to be seen. The
Home Guards yelled triumphantly and turned
on their backs behind their breastwork to reload
their guns. Then Tom managed to find
his voice; but it sounded so strangely that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
hardly knew whether it belonged to him or
not.</p>

<p>"That's the way to make the Yankees hunt
their holes," he said, in trembling tones.
"Give it to them again! Cut their old tub to
pieces, my brave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then a wide, dark opening appeared in
the side of the vessel nearest them, a black
object came slowly out, a thundering concussion
rent the air, and a thirty-two pound shell
came at them. It shrieked fearfully as it flew
over the levee above their heads, and made
such a horrid din when it exploded in the
thick woods behind them, scattering iron and
branches about and cutting down twigs and
leaves in a perfect shower, that for a single
instant the Home Guards were motionless with
astonishment and terror. They had not hurt
the gunboat at all, but they had made her captain
angry, and the fear that he might resent
the insult to his flag by firing more shells at
them sent the Home Guards to their saddles
in hot haste; and with Captain Tom, who rode
the swiftest horse, far in the lead, they struck
out for home at a better pace than they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
ever travelled before. And they never drew
rein until they had left the dangerous neighborhood
miles behind.</p>

<p>"It was the narrowest escape from an ambuscade
I ever had in my life," said Captain
Tom to the first man he met when he rode into
Mooreville that night, "and if it hadn't been
for my promptness in getting out of there I
shouldn't have had a man left. We'd have
been cut to pieces or captured, the last one of
us. We didn't see any enemy except the ship
we fired at, but a minute or so after she opened
on us a battery of flying artillery, that had all
the while been concealed in the timber in our
rear, cut loose on us with all its guns, and it's
a miracle that one of us escaped to tell the
story of the battle."</p>

<p>"But my partner came from Baton Rouge
to-day," said the man doubtfully, "and he
declares that there are no Yankee troops in the
country this side of New Orleans. So where
did that battery come from?"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe any such stuff," replied
Tom indignantly. "I tell you the
woods are full of them, and they are liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
to come to Mooreville between now and sunrise."</p>

<p>If no one else believed his story Tom believed
it himself, and the consequence was he
slept in his chair that night. But for some
reason the Yankees did not appear as he had
predicted, and they might have postponed
their coming indefinitely had it not been for
the lawless acts of Captain Tom's own men.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">THE CONSCRIPT'S FRIEND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Tom Randolph</span> would have been very
angry indeed if anyone had told him that
the noise that thirty-two pound shell made
when it exploded in the woods, and led him
and his men to believe that there was a Union
battery concealed there, had frightened all
the war spirit out of him, but it is a fact that
after his experience with the gunboat he did
not show the least desire to take the field again
at the head of his company. Everybody knew
that there were no Federal troops in Baton
Rouge, but there were war vessels in the Mississippi
holding the city under their guns, and
their presence had a depressing effect upon a
good many red-hot rebels besides Tom Randolph.
More than that, General Butler had
assumed command at New Orleans; and the
energetic and effective way in which he dealt
with treason there opened the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Mooreville people to the fact that there might
be a day of settlement coming for them also,
and that it would be well if they could have
a tolerably clean record to show when the invading
army moved up to take possession of
Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>This was the way Mr. Randolph and some of
his neighbors looked at the situation; and acting
upon the hints they dropped in his presence,
Tom concealed his uniform and sword
in the garret, where he thought no one would
be likely to look for them. He was getting
tired of war anyway, he said, and wished the
past could be blotted out and things be as they
were before South Carolina, by her senseless
act of secession, brought so much trouble upon
him and his friends. He was not as disgusted
and angry as a good Confederate ought to have
been when he heard a man from Baton Rouge
affirm that after all the Yankees were not such
a bad sort when one became acquainted with
them, and that some of the towns-people were
not ashamed to confess to a friendly feeling
for the crews of the gunboats that were anchored
in front of the city. The blue-jackets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
always acted like gentlemen when they came
ashore, and, true to their instincts of traffic,
had established a lively little trade with the
citizens. They purchased everything the latter
had to sell in the way of garden-truck, milk,
butter, and eggs, and paid for all they got in
good money; or, what was better, in coffee, tea
(store tea too, and not sassafras), wheat flour,
and salt. It is true that the salt was not as
fine nor as clean as some they had seen, for it
had been taken from the brine of the beef and
pork barrels with which the store-rooms of the
gunboats were abundantly supplied; but it
was acceptable to people who had boiled down
the dirt floors of their smoke-houses in order
to get the salt that had trickled off the hams
and sides of bacon which had been cured there
in better times. The gunboat officers also
sent their soiled linen ashore to be washed, so
that not a day passed during which there was
not more or less communication with the fleet.</p>

<p>This was a pleasant state of affairs all
around, especially to the victorious blue-jackets,
who had grown tired of fighting and
wanted all the shore liberty they could get,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and it might have continued until the Confederate
General Breckenridge made his unsuccessful
attempt to regain control of the
Mississippi above New Orleans had it not been
for two things: the Confederate Conscription
Act, and the determination on the part of the
Home Guards to evade it. The passage of
that act was like a destructive thunder-bolt
from a clear sky, and there were those in
Mooreville who refused to believe that their
chosen rulers would be guilty of such perfidy;
but the news had hardly been received before
the enrolling officer put in his appearance,
thus proving the truth of what we have
already said&mdash;that the Richmond Government
developed into a despotism so suddenly that it
was plain the machinery for it had been prepared
long before.</p>

<p>The enrolling officer, Captain Roach, was a
dapper little fellow who did not look as
though he had seen much service, and, indeed,
he hadn't seen a day of it; for when he received
his commission and orders from the
Governor he was a practising lawyer in a small
inland town. Beyond the very slight knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
which he had been able to gain from his
printed instructions, he knew nothing of his
duties or of soldiering; but his common-sense
taught him that as Tom Randolph's commission
was older than his own, military etiquette
required that he should call upon Tom without
any unnecessary delay&mdash;not to report to him,
for Tom was not in the Confederate service or
in any way connected with the conscription
business, but merely to show him proper
respect. He reached Mooreville in the morning,
spent the rest of the day in opening an
office and spreading abroad the news of his
arrival, so that those whose duty it was to
be conscripted would have no trouble in finding
him, and the next morning mounted his
horse and set out to find Captain Randolph.
The first man he met on the road was Tom's
first lieutenant. Captain Roach did not know
him, but he saw that Lambert was anxious to
ride on without speaking, and perhaps that
was the reason he drew rein and accosted him.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said the captain pleasantly.
"You know I have opened an office in
Kimberly's store, I suppose?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"Say! What made you ask me that question
for?" demanded Lambert, who was
instantly on his guard.</p>

<p>"Because I take you to be over eighteen
and under thirty-five, and would like to have
you drop around and see me," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I aint a-going to do it; and that
settles it. See?"</p>

<p>"Really I <i>don't</i> see how you can get out of
it."</p>

<p>"Don't, hey? Well, I do. I aint Confedrit.
I'm State Rights."</p>

<p>"Are you not aware that there are no State
Rights people any more?" asked the captain.
"The conscription act that has just been
passed withdraws all non-exempt citizens between
the ages of eighteen and thirty-five from
State control, and places them absolutely at the
disposal of the President during the war."</p>

<p>"But I aint agreeing to no such 'rangement,
don't you know?" exclaimed Lambert, who
did not like to see the enrolling officer so quiet
and confident, for it looked as though he knew
what he was talking about. "That was just
what Lincoln wanted to do when he called on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
our Gov'nor for soldiers to whop South Car'liny;
but our Gov'nor he said he wasn't that
kind of a feller, and his men shouldn't go
out of the State. Why don't he stick to
his word and say the same to Jeff Davis?"</p>

<p>"My friend, you don't understand the situation
at all&mdash;&mdash;" began the captain.</p>

<p>"Better'n you do, by a long sight," interrupted
Lambert. "I aint agreeing to no such
bargain, I tell you. Them as wants to go to
Virginy to light for the 'Federacy can go for
all me; but I don't want to go, and, by gum!
I won't. And furder, I'm a Home Guard."</p>

<p>"In your case that doesn't matter. The
government would be quite willing to stretch
a point in favor of home organizations that
have proved themselves to be worth something,
but you Mooreville fellows haven't done the
first thing for the cause. You have turned
some of our friends against us, but where are
the Yankees you have shot, and how many
prisoners have you taken?"</p>

<p>"Look here, by gum!" exclaimed the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I have heard all about you, and the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
says in the letter he sent with my commission
that the best thing I can do is to send
you to a camp of instruction," continued the
captain. "You are no good here, for you
don't do anything."</p>

<p>"Dog-gone my pictur'! What's the reason
we aint been doing something for the cause
right along?" shouted Lambert, his red face
showing that he was getting angry. "We've
been the means of keeping the Union men in
these parts from rising up and taking the
country for the Yankees, and more'n that&mdash;we
licked a gunboat in the river. Who told you
we aint done nothing? It must be some
enemy of ourn who aint got the spirit to jine
in with us, and if I can find out who he is I'll
make him sorry for it, I bet you. But you
can't conscript me, I tell you. I'm an officer
appointed by the Gov'nor."</p>

<p>"Ah! That does make a difference, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon it does," said Lambert,
with a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to have your commission
with you? Or will you tell me when I can
see it?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>This was what Lambert himself would have
called a "side-winder," and his first thought
was to hunt up Tom Randolph, and stand over
him with his riding-whip until he had seen
him write to the Governor asking for that
long delayed commission. Tom had often
promised to do it, but he never had, and now
Lambert was likely to see trouble on account
of his negligence.</p>

<p>"I am first leftenant of our company; my
commission is all right, and that settles that
point," said he at length. "If the Yankee
General Butler brings his army from New Orleans
to capture Mooreville he will run against
a snag, for he will find me and my men here
to stop him. We jined to guard our homes.
That's why they call us Home Guards, and
that settles the other point you was speaking
of. We aint got no pris'ners to show, kase
there aint no Yankees come nigh us; but we
are just as much use here as we would be up
there in Virginy."</p>

<p>"We need every man we can get," replied
Captain Roach. "Those who do not
come of their own free will must expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
to be taken by force, unless they can show
that they are of use at home. You Mooreville
Home Guards have had the finest
chance in the world to make a name for
yourselves. Why didn't you drive those
gunboats away from Baton Rouge long
ago?"</p>

<p>"Shucks!" exclaimed Lambert. "Why,
man alive, they've got cannons on 'em."</p>

<p>"What of it? Couldn't you hide behind
the levee, where you would be safe, and pick
off every sailor who showed his head above
decks? Couldn't you keep those small boats
from coming ashore and going back loaded
down with provisions? You have been giving
aid and comfort to the enemy by permitting
such things, and that's contrary to law. But
I must ride along, for I am on my way to visit
Captain Randolph. I am not sure that you
are exempt simply because you are an officer in
the State militia, but will tell you the next
time we meet."</p>

<p>"You needn't mind looking it up, for I aint
going, I tell you. But I'll tell you one thing,
and that aint two: if you take me you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
have to take Tom Randolph likewise. I'll
raise a fuss if you don't."</p>

<p>The two separated, and the enrolling officer
kept on his way to the home of Captain Randolph,
who had somehow heard that he might
look for a distinguished visitor on this particular
morning, and was thrown into a state
of great excitement by the unwelcome news.
The presence of the enrolling officer in town
was all the evidence Tom needed to prove that
there was no immediate danger of an invasion
by the Federals, so he brought his uniform
from its hiding place in the garret; and when
he had arrayed himself in it, and leaned his
sword in one corner of the gallery to show that
he was prepared to answer when duty called,
he was ready for the visit&mdash;that is, as ready as
he ever would be, for he would not have seen
Captain Roach at all if he could have thought
of any way to avoid it. Rumor said that the
captain looked as though he might have come
out of some lady's bandbox, but all the same
Tom supposed him to be a Confederate veteran
who had seen service on many a hardly contested
field, and who would overawe him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
his profound knowledge of military matters.
Tom wished now that he had made a little
better fight with that gunboat, or that he had
slipped into Baton Rouge some dark night
with a few picked men and pulled down the
flag that the Yankee sailors had hoisted over
the arsenal.</p>

<p>"Oh, what honors I might have gained for
myself if I had only thought of these things
before," he said to his mother. He always
went to her with his troubles now, or when he
stood in need of encouragement and advice,
his father having told him somewhat sharply
that he had washed his hands of the Home
Guards and never wanted to hear of them
again as long as he lived. "But that is the
way it is with me. My wit comes too slow to
be of any use."</p>

<p>"I am very glad that you did not think
of them before, you reckless boy," replied
Mrs. Randolph. "Your record is better
than I wish it was, for I am afraid it
will take you into the army. What would
you do if this enrolling officer should decide
to take the company just as it stands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and swear you into the Confederate service?"</p>

<p>"Cæsar's ghost!" cried Captain Tom, in
great alarm. "If my record as a loyal soldier
leads him to do that, I shall be sorry I ever
put on this uniform. What could I do?"</p>

<p>"Could you not follow the same course
that Rodney Gray pursued, when General
Lacey came up from New Orleans to swear
the Mooreville Rangers into the Confederate
Army?" inquired Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"Mother, if you were a man you would be
a general yourself," exclaimed Tom, his fears
vanishing on the instant. "If a first duty
sergeant can back down a major-general, I
reckon a captain in the State militia can do
the same for a Confederate captain."</p>

<p>He spoke boldly enough, but when one of
the house servants came in to tell him that
there was a strange soldier riding into the
yard he felt his courage oozing out at the
ends of his fingers, and he would hardly have
dared to go to the door to meet his visitor
if his mother had not assured him that she
would go also, and that she would remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
close at his side to support him during the
dreaded interview.</p>

<p>The enrolling officer did not look like a very
stern soldier, she told herself, when she saw
him get off his horse and shake hands with
Tom, who had hastened down the steps to meet
him; but then he was backed up by the whole
tremendous power of the Confederate Government,
and it was to her interest and Tom's to
make a friend of him if she could. Captain
Roach was equally anxious to secure Tom's
assistance in the disagreeable and perhaps dangerous
work he had to do, and the consequence
was it was no trouble at all for them to get acquainted,
or to come to an understanding with
one another. After they had spent a few
minutes in talking over the situation, and the
enrolling officer had shown his written instructions,
as well as a copy of the law by which
he was supposed to be governed, the latter
said:</p>

<p>"What surprises me very much is that
there is not the first word said about exemptions.
Whether it was an oversight or not
the fact remains that, according to this law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
every man between the specified ages must be
conscripted."</p>

<p>"And that is perfectly right," said Captain
Tom, making a hurried mental list of certain
persons in the neighborhood whom he would
be glad to see go first of all. "Everybody except
our Home Guards."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Captain Roach in tones so
decided that Tom's under jaw began to drop
down. "The law excepts nobody; but wait a
minute. After the regiments and companies
that have gone to the front from this State are
filled up, the rest of the conscripts will remain
at home as a reserve to be drawn upon at intervals
of not less than three months, so that
our organizations in the field can be kept
always full. Now, why can't you help me
so as to keep your company of Home Guards
together as long as possible? If we work it
right perhaps you will not be called upon
at all."</p>

<p>"That's the idea!" exclaimed Tom, greatly
relieved, while his mother smiled her approval
of the suggestion, and told Captain Roach on
the spot that she expected him to stay to dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and as long as he remained in that part
of the country to make himself as free in her
house as he would in his own. When she
ceased speaking Tom continued: "I am like
Nathan Hale, who, when the British were
about to hang him as a spy, said he was sorry
he had but one life to give to his country; but
for all that I should like to stay here until I
have seen some of our neighbors who have had
so much to say against the South sent to the
front. But how shall I work it to keep my
company together?"</p>

<p>"By doing as you have suggested," replied
the captain. "By first sending away those
who ought to be made to fight for the South,
since they have had so much to say against
her and her cause. Perhaps by the time they
have been killed off our independence will be
acknowledged; and then we shall not need
any more soldiers."</p>

<p>"That's the idea!" said Tom again. "But
how can the Home Guards help you?"</p>

<p>"By serving in place of the troops that I
am authorized to call on for assistance," answered
Captain Roach. "There will be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
camp of instruction established somewhere in
the vicinity very shortly, and it will be my
duty to forward my conscripts to that camp
as fast as I can get them together. Of course
they will not go willingly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," interrupted Captain Tom.
"You want me to send some of my men with
them as guards."</p>

<p>"Exactly. It will be a feather in your cap
as well as in mine if we can attend to the
business without calling upon the government
for aid. I don't want to do that if I can avoid
it, for every man we can raise is needed at
the front to resist McClellan's advance upon
Richmond. We must be alive, for there's
going to be hot work up there."</p>

<p>"I am with you; and I don't know of
anything that would suit the Home Guards
better," replied Tom, glad of the opportunity
to gain a little cheap notoriety without putting
himself in danger; and when Captain
Roach rode away from the house after dinner
Tom accompanied him to his office in Kimberly's
store, and assisted in obtaining some
poll-books from which he could make out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
list of the unhappy men who were subject to
military duty under the terms of the Conscription
Act.</p>

<p>Of course there were a goodly number of
young fellows in the settlement between the
ages of eighteen and twenty-one whose names
did not appear on the poll-books, for they
were not voters; but Tom had them in his
mind, and with his mother's aid and Lambert's
he succeeded during the following week
in making out a complete list of them. At
the head of the list stood the name of Edward
Griffin, Drummond's assistant operator, who
had warned Rodney Gray that he was to be
arrested the moment he left the boat at St.
Louis; but Drummond's name did not appear
at all.</p>

<p>"Griffin is a particular friend of one of my
worst enemies," explained Tom. "Not only
is he strong for the Union, but he has had a
good deal to say about me and my company
behind our backs, and I want you to serve a
notice on him the first thing you do. I wish
they would make haste and establish that
camp of instruction, and when Griffin is sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
there I want to command the squad that goes
with him. I wish, too, that Rodney Gray was
here to go with him."</p>

<p>In the meantime events proved that the
people of the South were not as willing to
submit to the despotic acts of their government
as they ought to have been, especially in
Georgia and Arkansas, "where it seemed that
a conflict might arise between State and Confederate
authorities." Officers of the militia
in the former State were arrested by the enrolling
officers, but the Governor demanded
their release and threatened to arrest the Confederates
if they did not let his State officers
alone. The Richmond Government yielded
the point, but said to the Governor of Georgia,
through the Secretary of War: "If you arrest
any of our enrolling officers in their attempts
to get men to fill up the Georgia regiments
now in the face of the enemy, you will
cause great mischief. I think we may as well
drive out our common enemy before we make
war upon each other." In Arkansas Governor
Rector threatened to secede from the Confederacy,
and called for 4500 men to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the State, adding that "the troops raised
under this call are intended exclusively for
home protection, and will not, under any circumstances,
be transferred to the Confederate
service without their consent." In short, the
Confederacy was in a very bad way, and their
authorities knew it; for on the 21st of April the
congress "adjourned in such haste as to show
that the members were anxious to provide for
their own personal safety." That was the
time when a rebel newspaper invented the
word "skedaddle," and that was the time too
when McClellan could have taken Richmond;
but he "wasted three full months, every day
of which was of vital moment to the Confederacy,
in doing nothing," and when at last
he was ready to advance, he found himself
confronted by an army that was larger than
his own.</p>

<p>The murmurs of dissatisfaction that arose
all over the South when that sweeping Conscription
Act was passed were not entirely lost
upon the Richmond government, and the next
news that came to Mooreville was that another
act had been passed providing for exemptions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Rodney Gray's father was one of the first to
hear of it, and the next time he went to
Mooreville he stopped at the telegraph office
and called Ned Griffin to the door. The young
fellow had been very much distressed ever
since he received notice from Captain Roach to
hold himself in readiness to march to the camp
of instruction with the first squad of conscripts
that left town, and Tom Randolph had been
mean enough to let him know how his name
happened to be first on the list. Griffin was
the only support of a widowed mother, and
he knew that things would go hard with her
when the small sum he received for his work
in the telegraph office ceased to come into her
hands every month. More than that, he believed
in the Union and the flag that waved
over it, and did not want to fight against his
principles. When he came to the door in answer
to Mr. Gray's hail he looked as though
he had lost the last friend he had in the world.</p>

<p>"I came here to cheer you up a bit by telling
you that you need not go into the army
if you don't want to," was the way in which
Rodney's father announced the object of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
visit. "The new law provides for the exemption
of one agriculturist on each farm, where
there is no white male adult not liable to military
duty, employing fifteen able-bodied negroes,
on condition that the party exempted
shall give bond to deliver to the government,
in the next twelve months, 100 pounds of
bacon or its equivalent in salt pork, and 100
pounds of beef for each able-bodied slave employed
on said farm."</p>

<p>Young Griffin gasped for breath, but did not
say a word in reply. He did not smile either,
as Mr. Gray did, for he failed to see how that
new law could affect him.</p>

<p>"Now, I happen to have such a farm up the
river road," continued the planter. "There's
no one on it but a driver to look out for
things, and if you have a mind to go up and
take charge of it I shall be glad to have you.
And I think I can put you in the way of earning
more money than you do now."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Gray, I am not an overseer,"
stammered Griffin, who wished from the bottom
of his heart that he had chosen that
humble but useful vocation instead of telegraphy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
"I don't know the first thing about
farming."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't learn younger, can you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I&mdash;you see&mdash;the fact of the
matter is, where are the bacon and beef to
come from? If they were selling at a dollar a
ton I couldn't buy a hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"You have a whole year in which to pay it,"
replied Mr. Gray. "But I don't believe in
going in debt, and perhaps we can scare up
cattle and hogs enough on the farm to fill the
bill; and I shall depend on you to raise others
to replace them. I think you had better go.
You can take your mother along to keep
house for you, and I don't see why you can't
live as well there on the farm as you do here
in town. Tell Drummond to come out here a
moment."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray," said Griffin, with tears of gratitude
in his eyes, "I wish you would ride
around to our house and let mother thank you
for your kindness. I don't know how."</p>

<p>"I will save her and you the trouble," said
the planter, bending down from his saddle
and speaking in tones so low that none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
passers-by could hear his words. "Who
was it that kept Rodney from falling into
the clutches of that Yankee cotton factor
in St. Louis? Tell Drummond to come
here."</p>

<p>Drummond came, and Griffin afterward said
that he never saw so mad a man as his chief
was when the planter explained matters to
him in a few brief but emphatic words. The
operator had nothing against Griffin personally,
but Tom Randolph had, and as Tom
had been friendly enough to keep his name
off the enrolling list, Drummond felt in
duty bound to make common cause with
him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray, I am afraid it won't work,"
said he. "Griffin was conscripted before that
exemption law was passed."</p>

<p>"I am prepared to take the risk," was
the quiet rejoinder. "In case objections
are made we shall insist on having the first
conscripts selected from the poll-books instead
of from a private list; and if any objections
are made to that we will report the
matter at headquarters. Your name comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
pretty close to the top of the list, Mr. Drummond."</p>

<p>The operator was frightened and saw plainly
that it would not be a safe piece of business to
make an enemy of Mr. Gray; he knew too
much. Besides, he was one of the richest
planters in the State, and such men always
exerted a good deal of influence when they set
about it.</p>

<p>"Of course, sir, I hope it will work," Drummond
hastened to say, "for I don't want to
see anybody forced into the army. I only
said I was afraid it wouldn't."</p>

<p>"I understand. Ned, you might as well
start now as any time. Go and say good-by
to your mother, and hurry up to my house. I
will be there in a couple of hours, and after
we have had a snack we'll ride up to the
farm."</p>

<p>From the telegraph office Mr. Gray went to
Kimberly's store, where he created another
commotion. Tom Randolph was there, and so
were some of the Home Guards, who had of
late taken to spending all their waking hours
at the enrolling office. Captain Tom would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
have protested loudly if his amazement and
chagrin had permitted him to speak at all, but
Captain Roach had no objections to offer when
Mr. Gray told him that he would have to find
someone to take Griffin's place in the first
squad of conscripts that was sent to the camp
of instruction, for Griffin himself was exempt
under the law, or would be as soon as he had
taken his new position.</p>

<p>"I am surprised at you," exclaimed Tom
when Mr. Gray had mounted his horse and
galloped away. "You mustn't let that man
Griffin off; you can't. Haven't I told you
that he is Union?"</p>

<p>"I have my own interests to look out for,"
replied Captain Roach rather sharply, "and
consequently I cannot afford to get into trouble
with such a man as Mr. Gray. He didn't
say much, nor did he bluster at all; but I
knew by the glint in his eye that there was
a whole battery of big guns behind the little
he did say, and that he was ready to turn
them loose on me if I said an ugly word to
him. We haven't been playing square since
this thing began, and he knows it; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
he should insist on having a new deal from
the poll-books, with your list of names thrown
out, where would your friend Drummond
be? Where would you be, seeing that even
Home Guards are not exempt?"</p>

<p>"I just don't care; and that's all there is
about it," whined Tom, who was mad enough
to cry if he had been alone. "They ought to
be exempt, and I don't see why those Richmond
fellows left them out."</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there. They left
them out; but in working to keep you with
me I have practically exempted you, and that
is something I had no business to do. I can't
imagine where Mr. Gray got his information,
but he understands all this, and if he should
report me to the Governor I'd have to join
some regiment in the field; and that's a place
I want to keep away from as bad as you
do."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say that things have come to
a pretty pass when a man can say who shall
go into the army and who shall not, just because
he happens to have a little money," declared
Tom spitefully.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the way the thing stands, and if
you want to stay at home you and your men
had better be doing something."</p>

<p>These chance words, which really did not
mean anything, set some of the Home Guards
to thinking.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">LIEUTENANT LAMBERT'S CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Of</span> course the principal topic of conversation
at the enrolling office during the
rest of the day was Mr. Gray's unexpected interference
in behalf of Ned Griffin, the conscript.
It frightened Captain Roach, enraged
and disgusted Tom Randolph, and put Lieutenant
Lambert into a very anxious frame of
mind. The latter was obliged to confess that
his chances for keeping out of the army were
very slim indeed.</p>

<p>"That's the way the thing stands, and if
you want to stay at home you and your men
had better be doing something," he kept saying
to himself as he galloped along the dusty
road on his way home. It was easy enough
for Captain Roach to talk, but what was there
that the Home Guards could do to distinguish
themselves, seeing that the Federal troops were
so secure in their position at New Orleans that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the whole Confederate Army could not drive
them out, and that the gunboats in the river
in front of Baton Rouge could not be whipped
by men who were armed only with squirrel
rifles and shot guns? Lambert had been turning
the matter over in his mind ever since Mr.
Gray left the enrolling office in the morning,
and now he did something which he had declared
he never would do as long as he lived.
He went out of his way to ask the advice of
a Confederate veteran who had just returned
from the Army of the Centre disabled by
wounds received in battle.</p>

<p>There were several of these crippled veterans
in the neighborhood, and they had been
so many thorns in Tom Randolph's side ever
since they first began straggling home from
the front. To begin with, they turned up their
noses at the Home Guards, and made all manner
of sport of their finely uniformed captain
when they saw him riding along the road slyly
pricking his horse with his spurs to make the
animal prance and go sideways, as an officer's
horse ought to do. They laughed, too, when
they heard the Home Guards tell of their fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
with that gunboat, and some of them went so
far as to declare that, disabled as they were
and half dead with camp fever besides, they
could arm themselves with corn-stalks and
drive Tom Randolph and his warriors into the
Mississippi River.</p>

<p>In the next place, almost all these veterans
had brought home with them a goodly supply
of Yankee relics and trophies in the shape of
uniform coats, pants, caps, and overcoats that
had been picked up on the field, and which,
for some reason or other, they seemed anxious
to get off their hands. So they offered them
to the Home Guards in exchange for citizens'
clothing of equal or less value, and the latter
were always found willing to trade. Captain
Tom was disgusted and angry when first one
man and then another appeared at the enrolling
office clad in some portion of a shabby
uniform that had once belonged to a Federal
trooper or infantry-man, and ordered the wearers
to clear out and never come there again
unless they could come properly dressed; but
the Home Guards paid no sort of attention to
him. They were soldiers, they said, and since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
their own government did not think enough of
them to provide them with uniforms they felt
at liberty to obtain them where they could.
Besides, their new clothes, even though they
were well worn and had once belonged to
Lincoln's hirelings, were warm and comfortable,
and the blue overcoats would keep out
next winter's cold as effectually as gray
ones. Much against his will Tom finally appealed
to the enrolling officer; but the latter
could not help him, for he had no authority
over the Home Guards.</p>

<p>"But you might threaten to conscript them
if they don't obey my orders," suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to do it for a little thing
like that," replied Captain Roach. "They've
got the uniforms, and I don't see how you
are going to keep them from wearing them.
What difference does it make, anyway? You
don't have to go on dress parade."</p>

<p>"No matter for that," replied Tom. "I
didn't enter the service to command a lot of
Yankees, and I won't do it. Suppose a general
officer should happen along and order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
them out for drill and inspection! I'd feel so
ashamed of myself that I know I should take
to my heels."</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy on that score," was
the captain's answer. "If you don't take to
your heels until that happens you will never
run. Judging from what I have learned since
I have been here, the government cares no
more for companies of this kind than it does
for so many wild hogs in the woods. If it
were not for you and your mother I would
conscript the last one of them."</p>

<p>"But what do you suppose makes the returned
veterans so anxious to get rid of these
Yankee uniforms and things?" continued
Tom. "It looks to me as though there might
be something back of it."</p>

<p>"That's the way it looks to me, too," replied
Captain Roach. "They don't want to
have a Yankee scouting party ride up on them
suddenly and say: 'Look here, Johnny; have
you been robbing some wounded or captive
Yank? If not, where did you get those blue
clothes?'"</p>

<p>"But the Yankees are not here," cried Tom.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"I know they are not here now, but they're
coming; and if they keep on besting us at
every point, as they are doing at this minute,
they will be here before long, too. You
needn't think that Farragut is going to remain
idle down the river, or that Flag-Officer Davis
is going to keep on doing nothing up the river
while we are fortifying Vicksburg. There's
going to be fun here one of these days."</p>

<p>And sure enough there was. It came much
sooner than Captain Roach had any reason to
think it would, and Lieutenant Lambert of the
Home Guards, whom we saw on his way to
ask advice of a Confederate veteran, was the
man who did the most to help it along. He
found the soldier of whom he was in search
at his home. He was sitting on the gallery
enjoying his after supper smoke; but when
he saw the Home Guard alight at his gate
he staggered to his feet, laid hold of the
crutch that leaned against the house behind
his chair, and said, in mock alarm:</p>

<p>"The man you want to see don't live here
no more. He done moved outen the country
two year ago come next July. Clear yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
I'm that skeared of gray-back soldiers that I
can't sleep none fur a week after seein' one of
'em."</p>

<p>"Aw! Quit your nonsense," growled Lambert,
"or, by gum! I'll come there and lick
ye even if you aint got but one leg to defend
yourself with." He hitched his horse at the
fence, shook hands with the veteran, then
seated himself on the porch close by his chair
and continued: "Me and you have always
been the best kind of friends, Abner, and I
don't want you to sniff at me just kase you've
been shot by the Yankees and I aint."</p>

<p>"I won't, Sile; I won't never do the like no
more. But a Home Guard! And lickin' a
gunboat that's got 'leven inches of iron on her
sides and four foot of solid oak back of that,
with nothing in the wide world but popguns!"
said the veteran, taking his pipe from
his mouth to indulge in a hearty peal of
laughter. "<i>And</i> Tom Randolph fur a cap'n.
That there is a leetle the worst I ever heard of.
Hey-youp! Steady on the left centre!" he
yelled, dropping his crutch upon the gallery
and grasping with both hands the stump of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
his leg, which he had wrenched a little too
severely during his paroxysms of merriment.
"I almost disremembered that I aint got only
part of a leg on this side. I left the rest up to
Shiloh. I'm glad to see you again, Sile; I
am so. But I would be a heap gladder if me
and you had chawed hard-tack and fit the
Yanks together. Then you wouldn't be no
such triflin' thing as a Home Guard."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to fight no Yanks," said
Lambert truthfully.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to fight no Yanks? Well,
I don't know's I'm blamin' you fur that.
They aint by no means the easy fellers to
lick that we uns thought they was goin' to
be, and when they set up that yell of theirn to
let we uns know they was comin' fur us&mdash;I tell
you, Sile, my hair always riz when I heard
that yell, and I wisht I was to home grabblin'
fur taters."</p>

<p>"Then what makes you poke fun at me
fur?" demanded Lambert. "I am to home
now and I want to stay; but Cap'n Roach
he allows that if we uns don't do something
pretty sudden we're liable to be conscripted."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Like enough. Then why don't you uns
do something?"</p>

<p>"That's what I come here to see you about.
What is they, I'd like to know, that we can
do? If the Yanks would only come where we
be [you will notice that Lambert did not say
"Yankees" any more. He copied the veteran
and used the shorter word], we uns could
show the folks about here that we Home
Guards aint by no means the useless truck
they take us to be; but we can't go all the
way to New Orleans fur the sake of fightin'
'em."</p>

<p>"You uns will see Yanks enough if you
stay right where you be," said the veteran,
with another laugh. "I aint spilin' fur a
sight at any more of 'em, but all the same I
look to see them ridin' right along this road
while I am settin' on my gallery watchin' of
'em. They aint come this clost to Mooreville
to go away without seein' it. They're hoppin'
us right along, and we had oughter
be whopped."</p>

<p>"Now, just listen at you!" said Lambert
reproachfully.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm only tellin' you what I know," said
the veteran in earnest tones. "Look at the
way they're doin'! When the law was passed
that everybody must be conscripted, why
didn't they go to work and conscript everybody?
Why didn't they put the old soldiers
ahead and shove the Johnny Raws into the
ranks? Steader that they let the old soldiers
stay in the ranks, and put over them fur officers
a lot of new chaps who couldn't a'told
a Yank from a ground-hog if they had seed
the two standin' in one place. We uns aint a
goin' to whop nobody with a lot of greenhorns
to command us, and although I aint by no
means glad to go hobblin' through the world
on one leg, I am mighty glad of an excuse to
get outen the army. Now, there's that there
Rodney Gray."</p>

<p>"By gum! I wish he was here to be conscripted,"
exclaimed Lambert.</p>

<p>The veteran took his pipe from his mouth,
blew a cloud of smoke into the air, and looked
at his companion with an expression on his
face which seemed to say that he did not know
whether to laugh or get angry. But finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
he concluded to laugh, and he did so most uproariously,
rolling about on his chair as if he
were in danger of falling out of it, but all the
while taking good care not to give his wounded
leg another wrench.</p>

<p>"Why, man, he's a soldier, Rodney is," he
said as soon as he could speak, "and a mighty
good one, too. He's been in more battles
than me, and that's useless. He fit all through
Missoury with Daddy Price, and then they
brung him over to the Army of the Centre,
and that's where I seen him. They wanted
to make a big officer of him, but Rodney he
wouldn't have it so, kase he's plum sick of
the war, same as I be, and allows to come
home soon's his extry three months is out.
You can't tech Rodney Gray."</p>

<p>"I know that well enough, but I wish we
could. You see, Tom Randolph&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't say no more," laughed the
veteran. "Rodney got an office in Cap'n
Hubbard's Rangers and Tom didn't, and Tom
is mad about it and wants to spite Rodney in
some way. But he can't do it, and if he tries
it ole man Gray will make him wish he hadn't."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>"And ole man Gray is another chap I'd
like mighty well to see sent to the front," exclaimed
Lambert angrily; "but we can't touch
him neither. He showed his hand when he
come into the office this morning and told
Roach that he'd have to let that Griffin boy
go free, kase he allowed to buy him off with
bacon and beef; and Roach was that skeared
that he dassent open his mouth."</p>

<p>"What was he skeared of?"</p>

<p>"That ole man Gray would report him fur
leavin' the names of Tom Randolph's friends
off'n the conscript list, when he had oughter
put them on like he found them in the poll-books."</p>

<p>"Like enough," replied Abner. "And then
you and Tom Randolph and all the rest of
the Home Guards would have stood as fine
a chance of goin' to the front as Ned Griffin.
It would serve you just right fur trainin' under
such a no account cap'n as you have got.
Why don't you cut loose from him and do
something on your own hook? That would
be me if I was you."</p>

<p>"'Taint safe," replied Lambert, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
not yet forgotten that he brought himself into
trouble the last time he tried to do something
on his own hook. "Somehow our folks have
got to be mighty tender of the Union men
about here and don't like to have them pestered."</p>

<p>"You let your Union neighbors alone and
pester them that's got we'pons into their
hands," said the veteran indignantly. "You
uns aint got no call to fight them that can't
fight back; but there's them gunboats down
to the river."</p>

<p>"Well, what of 'em?" demanded Lambert,
trembling at the bare thought of again venturing
within gunshot of one of those black
monsters. "They've got cannons on 'em, and
they shoot balls bigger'n your head. Don't I
know? Aint I been in a fight with one of
'em?"</p>

<p>"Shucks!" sneered Abner. "You stand
about as much chance of bein' hit by one of
them big balls as you do of bein' struck by
lightnin'. I have seed me on the skirmish line
lyin' fur hours behind a stump that wasn't no
bigger'n a plug hat, while shell and solid shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
was tearin' up the ground all around me.
They don't do damage once a week less'n
they're drapped into a line of battle or into a
fort that is packed full of men."</p>

<p>"But how can we lick 'leven inches of iron
and four foot of solid oak?" protested Lambert.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" exclaimed the veteran. "I
aint talkin' about lickin' on 'em. I'm talkin'
about pesterin' of 'em&mdash;drivin' their row-boats
back when they start to come to the shore, and
pickin' off the officers as fast as they come
outen their holes in the cabin. You uns could
lay behind the levee and do that, and be as
safe as you be to home; kase the shells they
would send at you would all fly over your
heads, and when they bu'st they would be a
mile to your rear."</p>

<p>The lieutenant of the Home Guards was
overjoyed to hear these encouraging words fall
from the lips of a man who had faced the
Yankees in battle and knew what he was talking
about. He had given his friend Abner to
understand that he was one of the few who
followed Captain Tom when the latter rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
out with a handful of brave men to see if the
Union Army was advancing upon Mooreville
from Baton Rouge, but there was not a word
of truth in his story. He was one of the majority
who excused themselves and stayed
behind, and all he knew about that desperate
fight with the gunboat and the concealed battery
that opened on the rear of the Home
Guards was what his comrades told him. The
veteran did not seem to think that the big
guns on the war vessels were so very dangerous,
and Lambert began to pluck up courage.</p>

<p>"'Pears to me that Cap'n Roach said something
like that the first time I talked with
him," said the latter.</p>

<p>"Like enough; and if he did you can bet
that that is what he would do if he had as
many Home Guards under his command as
you have got. I can't fur the life of me see
what makes them Baton Rouge folks so very
friendly with the Yanks, anyhow. They take
'em into their houses and visit with 'em, and
feed 'em, dog-gone it all, and I say such
doings aint right. If ole Daddy Bragg was
here fur about five minutes he'd put a stop to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
all that friendship business, I bet you, and
like as not he'd have some of you Home
Guards shot fur lettin' it go on as long as it
has. Anyway, he'd kick Tom Randolph into
the ranks and put a soldier in his place.
That's the way they do things up in the Army
of the Centre."</p>

<p>The result of this interview was that when
Lieutenant Lambert took leave of the veteran
and rode home to a late supper he was fully
satisfied in his own mind that Tom Randolph
was totally unfit for the responsible position he
held, that the Home Guards, who under proper
leadership might have made themselves known
throughout the length and breadth of the
Confederacy, had been kept in check too long
already, and that he (Lambert), being second in
command of the company, had a perfect right
to take matters into his own hands without
saying a word to anybody about it. But it
was a somewhat delicate task, he told himself.
Although Lambert looked upon the friendly
relations existing between the crews of the
Union war vessels and the Baton Rouge people
as a burning disgrace, he did not relish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
idea of trying to bring them to an end, for the
citizens might not like it, and, worse than that,
they might make him trouble on account of
it; but something must be done or he would
be compelled to go into the army, seeing that
he had no rich and influential friend like Mr.
Gray to purchase his release with bacon and
beef. So Lambert's mind was made up, and
before he reached home his campaign was fully
planned.</p>

<p>"I'll raise a big squad and start for the city
to-morrow night," he soliloquized, flourishing
his riding-switch in the air to give emphasis to
his thoughts. "And if I once gain a footing
behind the levee I'll put a stop to that friendship
business, I bet you. I'll give the folks
to understand that we uns don't like the way
they're giving aid and comfort to the enemies
of their country, and make them Yankee gun-boatmen
stay on board their ships where they
belong. I'll take pains, too, to see that the
Gov'nor hears of it, and perhaps he'll say that
I had ought to be cap'n of the Home Guards
in place of Tom Randolph."</p>

<p>That was an encouraging thought, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
longer Lambert dwelt upon it the more excited
he became. He did not sleep much that night,
and after an early breakfast mounted his
horse and rode through the country to muster
his men; but as fast as he found them and unfolded
to them the details of his campaign he
was met by the same excuses and refusals that
Tom Randolph had vainly tried to combat.
The fighting member of the company, the one
who was always eager to shoot or hang the defenceless
Union men he assisted in robbing,
was feeling so very poorly on this particular
morning that he was thinking strongly of riding
over to a neighbor's to see if he could not
borrow a dose or two of quinine; the second
had promised to go to a log rolling; the third
had a lame horse and didn't rightly know
where he could go to get another; and not
more than three or four out of the fifty men
whom Lambert summoned to follow him to
Baton Rouge had the courage and honesty to
tell him that they did not like to do it.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind hiding behind the levee
and shooting a few Yankees," said Lieutenant
Moseley, "but they'll shoot back, and like as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
not that'll make the Baton Rouge folks mad
at us. Ask somebody else. You can get all
the men you want and I don't reckon I'll go."</p>

<p>Whenever a Home Guard talked to him in
this way Lambert always said in reply:</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you don't want to go and
win a name fur yourself you can stay to home
till Roach gets ready to conscript you. If you
were in Kimberly's store yesterday you must
have seen fur a fact that we uns aint safe
from going into the army just kase we happen
to belong to the Home Guards. Cap'n Roach
he has said time and again that we was liable
to go if we didn't wake up and do something,
and that if he had been our commander he
wouldn't have let them city people get on such
amazing good terms with the Yanks. Le's go
down there and make 'em quit it right now,
and say nothing to nobody till the thing is
done. Remember, I don't ask every man, but
only just them that we want to have stay in
the company. When we get back I'll give
Cap'n Roach a list of them that went with me,
and if he wants to conscript the others&mdash;them
that was afraid to face the enemies of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
country&mdash;and send them to the camp of instruction,
he can do it and welcome. Now,
what do you say?"</p>

<p>It was by the use of such arguments as these
that Lieutenant Lambert succeeded in inducing
some of his particular friends to believe that
it might be policy for them to join his expedition,
and that night they secretly gathered
at a designated place outside the town and
started for Baton Rouge. When they arrived
within sight of the church spires at daylight
they did not attract attention to themselves
by entering the city in a body, for Lambert
was afraid that some Union man or converted
rebel might suspect the object of their visit
and interfere with their designs by signalling
to the fleet. They separated and went in by
different roads and in small parties, and came
together again in the neighborhood of the
landing at which the boats from the fleet always
touched the shore, taking care to leave
their horses behind some warehouses out of
sight.</p>

<p>"Now be careful, everybody," commanded
Lambert, placing a fresh cap on his rifle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
waving his hand toward the levee as a signal
to his men to advance and conceal themselves
behind it. "We can't do 'em no damage from
here&mdash;it's too fur; so we must wait till some
of their row-boats come off."</p>

<p>The Home Guards bent themselves almost
double and stole across the clear space that
intervened between the warehouses and the
levee; and so cautious were they in their
movements that the quartermasters on watch
on the decks of the different gunboats, who
were constantly sweeping the banks on both
sides of the river with their long-distance spyglasses,
saw no signs of them, and so silent
that when they crept to the top of the levee
on their hands and knees and looked over it,
the negroes gathered at the landing below did
not know that there was anyone near them.
There were probably a dozen men, women, and
children in the group, and they were lying at
their ease on the ground or walking slowly
back and forth; but all of them turned their
gaze toward the gunboats now and then, as
if they were waiting for somebody to come
ashore. There were several covered baskets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and pails near by, and the sight of them was
enough to enrage Lieutenant Lambert, who
whispered to the man who lay next him behind
the levee:</p>

<p>"Pass the word along the line fur everybody
to keep under kiver. We've ketched them
niggers red-handed in the very act, fur there's
grub in them buckets and things; now you
just watch and see if there aint." Then he
raised his voice a little and said to the nearest
darkey: "What you folks doing there?
Who you looking fur?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for Mr. Wilcox, sah," was the
negro's prompt answer. He looked up and
saw two or three heads above the top of the
levee, but thought nothing of it. There were
a good many whites in Baton Rouge who did
not dare show themselves as freely to the
Yankee sailors as the people of his own color
did.</p>

<p>"Who's Mr. Wilcox?" demanded Lambert.</p>

<p>"He's de cater ob de steerage mess, sah;
de man what buys de breakfus' fur some of de
officers on dat fust boat," was the reply; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
although Lambert did not understand the
words any better than the negro did himself,
he gathered from them the idea that somebody
on the gunboat would come ashore for
his breakfast very shortly, and that he and
his warriors had reached the levee just in the
nick of time.</p>

<p>This cheering intelligence was passed along
the line in a whisper, and the Home Guards
pulled off their hats and were settling themselves
into comfortable positions behind the
levee to await the coming of the caterer's boat,
when they were startled by hearing someone
close beside them say, in frightened and protesting
tones:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, <i>gentlemen</i>, what are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>Lambert faced quickly around and saw
a couple of citizens standing at the base of
the levee where they could observe all that
was being done by the Home Guards; but
whether they had come upon his ambush by
accident or design the lieutenant did not
know or care to ask. He saw the necessity
for prompt action.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"Scrooch down right where you stand, so
that the Yanks can't see you," he commanded.</p>

<p>"But what are you gentlemen going to do?"
inquired one of the citizens, both of whom
obeyed Lambert's order and sank upon their
heels with alacrity when they saw the black
muzzles of three or four double-barrels swinging
in their direction.</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't see fur yourselves what
we uns are going to do I reckon I'll have to
tell you," replied the lieutenant of the Home
Guards, turning part way around so that he
could watch both negroes and citizens at the
same time, and see that no signals passed
from them to the fleet. "We're goin' to
break up the visitin' and tradin' that's been
going on between this town and the Yanks till
we are teetotally sick and tired of it. The
folks back in the country, who are all good
Confederits, don't like it; and me and my
men have come in here to say so in a way that
both you and the Yanks will understand."</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" exclaimed the man,
who seemed to be almost overcome with astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and alarm. "You are not going
to fire into those war vessels?"</p>

<p>"What's the reason I aint?" said Lambert
coolly. "You just wait till one of their row-boats
starts to come ashore and I'll show you."</p>

<p>"But consider for a moment&mdash;&mdash;" began
the citizen, his excitement bringing him to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Down you go again," interrupted Lambert,
drawing his cocked rifle to his shoulder.
"We uns have considered the whole business.
We know that we can't hurt 'leven inches of
iron and four foot of solid oak back of that
with we'pons like these we've got, but we
can make them blue-jackets mighty jubersome
about comin' ashore and being so very
friendly with you Baton Rouge folks; and
that's what we allow to do."</p>

<p>"In the name of God and humanity I protest
against such an outrage!" said one of
the men, whose pale face and firmly set lips
showed that he would not have stopped with
a mere protest if he had possessed the power
to do anything else.</p>

<p>"You must not think of it, you madman!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
cried the other. "Don't you know that the
boats will return your fire, and that they can
knock our town to pieces with a single broadside?
There is no telling how many innocent
women and children will be killed or maimed
through your act of folly."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why didn't you think of all
them things before you made friends with
the enemies of your country?" answered
Lambert. "But the gunboats won't fire on
women and children. Leastways they didn't
in New Orleans, and the folks in that burg
were about as sassy as they could well be."</p>

<p>"If you are determined to carry your crazy
scheme into execution, I beg that you will give
us a little time to remove our families to a
place of safety before you begin," said one of
the citizens as he and his companion arose to
their feet and turned to go away.</p>

<p>"Not much as anybody knows of, I won't,"
replied Lambert in savage tones.</p>

<p>"Just five minutes," pleaded the citizen.
"Perhaps we can take our wives and little
ones into the cellar before you will find it necessary
to open fire."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"Not one minute&mdash;not one second nor a half
of one," snarled the lieutenant, once more
raising his weapon to his shoulder. "I aint
a-goin' to have you shakin' a handkercher at
them boats to warn the Yanks that there's
something wrong here behind the levee. You
just squat down where you are till this thing
is over, and then you can go any place you
please."</p>

<p>"Watch out, Sile," said one of the Home
Guards suddenly. "There comes that feller
after his grub."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Lambert flopped over on his face
as if he had been shot, and saw a small boat,
with four men at the oars and two officers sitting
in the stern-sheets, come into view from
behind one of the war vessels and turn toward
the landing.</p>

<p>The time for him to win a name for himself
had arrived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">HOW IT RESULTED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">"I wouldn't</span> take ten gold dollars fur my
chance of being made cap'n of this company
of Home Guards, who would have been
conscripted to the last man if it hadn't been
fur me," thought Lieutenant Lambert as he
rolled over on his face and watched the cutter
rounding the stern of the nearest war vessel.
"Look wild, there!" he whispered almost
fiercely to his men. "Be sure and hold your
fire till they come clost in to the shore so that
every shot will tell. I don't want to hear
another word outen you two," he went on, addressing
himself to the citizens, who implored
him to stop where he was and not bring
destruction upon their town and death to
innocent people in it, as he surely would do
if he commanded his Home Guards to fire
upon that unarmed boat. "You're too big
cowards to fight the enemy yourselves, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
we uns had to come in here and do it fur you.
Hold steady, everybody!"</p>

<p>Although Lambert's men were all hunters
and good shots, they were not disciplined soldiers,
and that was all that saved the cutter's
crew from annihilation. They would have
been steady enough if they had been in the
woods watching a runway for deer, but watching
for Yankees was a different matter altogether;
and just as the Home Guards had
pushed their guns over the top of the levee,
making use of every clod and piece of driftwood
and inequality of the ground that came
handy for a screen, and Lieutenant Lambert
was cautiously lifting his head to observe the
progress the small boat was making toward
the landing, a deafening roar rang in his ear,
and the man at his side sprang to his feet,
stood bewildered for a moment, and then
dropped back to his place again. In pushing
his double-barrel over the levee with nervous
hands the valorous Home Guard had accidentally
discharged the piece, and the unexpected
report frightened him and threw his
comrades into some confusion. For an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
or two a few of them looked and acted as
though they wanted to take to their heels;
but the voice of Lieutenant Lambert, who was
the first to recover himself, checked them.</p>

<p>"Shoot! Fire!" he yelled. "Massy knows
'twon't do no good, and that is something
we can thank you fur, Ike Spencer. A man
that'll lay flat on the ground and let his gun
shoot itself off without orders can't be conscripted
any too quick to suit me, and I'll
introjuce you to Cap'n Roach soon's I get
home. Fire, I tell you!"</p>

<p>And the Home Guards fired&mdash;not all together
like trained soldiers, but one after
another, just as it happened; but the distance
was so great and their aim so bad that not
a man in the boat was injured. It stopped
instantly, however, and came no nearer the
landing; and on being hailed by the officer of
the deck, it turned about and went back to
the vessel to which it belonged. Then came
the very thing which the frightened citizens
had predicted and Lieutenant Lambert had
scouted.</p>

<p>No sooner had the small boat disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
around the stern of the war ship than a heavy
cloud of smoke rolled over the dark, muddy
surface of the river, a cannon roared, and the
embankment behind which Lieutenant Lambert
and his men were lying was jarred perceptibly,
as if some heavy body had been
dashed with violent force against it. The
instant's profound silence that followed was
broken, first by shouts and cries of terror from
the negroes on the bank, who scattered in all
directions, then by a muffled sound something
like the puff of a tired locomotive on an up
grade, and Lambert's view of the river was
shut off by a cloud of dirt and smoke that was
thrown high into the air by the explosion of
the shell that had buried itself in the ground
at the base of the levee. That was enough
for the Home Guards, who could not stand
so much noise at such close quarters. They
jumped to their feet, and fairly tumbled over
one another as they fled for safety behind the
warehouses where they had left their horses;
but even here vengeance pursued them, for the
next shell that came from the war vessel
crashed through the walls of the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
house, scattering bricks and mortar about
their ears, creating a panic among their untrained
steeds, and finally exploding in the
edge of the woods half a mile away.</p>

<p>"By gum, boys! Jump on and get outen
here!" shouted Lambert, who wished from
the bottom of his heart that he could be the
first to obey his own order. "Beats the
world how straight they can shoot with them
big guns of theirn. They'd win more turkeys
at a shooting match than the best man
among us."</p>

<p>For a few brief, perilous moments the terrified
horses refused to stand still long enough
for their equally terrified owners to mount;
but when, after many fruitless efforts, the
Home Guards succeeded in placing themselves
in their saddles, the stampede that followed
was something we cannot describe. They galloped
frantically along the road that ran behind
the levee, through the streets of the
town, which were by this time filled with pale
and excited citizens, who could not imagine
what the trouble was about, and did not know
which way to run for safety, and so out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the country, where the avenging shells could
not reach them. A Confederate veteran who
was present and witnessed the bombardment
told the writer that the Home Guards "deliberately
rode into the midst of the fleeing inhabitants,
selecting groups of terrified women
and children, into whom they galloped, trampling
many of them under the feet of their
horses, trusting that the humane and chivalrous
blue-jackets, who had been so lenient with
the insulting rabble at New Orleans, would
not follow them with their fire." We believe
this to be nothing but the truth; but whether
it is or not the fact remains that Lambert and
his men kept to the crowded streets as long as
they could, and the bursting shells followed
them through every turn they made, but unfortunately
without doing them the least
damage. Those who ought to have been
severely punished got off scot free, while the
innocent inhabitants suffered in wounds and
loss of property, for their town was set on fire
in half a dozen different places.</p>

<p>The Home Guards spread the utmost consternation
among the farmers who lived along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the line of their hurried flight, and who ran
out to the road and vainly implored the frantic
horsemen to draw rein long enough to tell
them what the firing was about, and if the
Yankees were coming at last to burn them out
of house and home. But it was not until the
roar of the big guns ceased entirely, and the
Home Guards were satisfied that they had
ridden beyond the reach of any stray shell
which might be sent after them, that those
who were leading in the retreat recovered their
courage sufficiently to slacken their speed so
that their comrades in the rear could come up.
Then they were willing to talk to the planters
along the road, but it is doubtful if they gave
them much reliable information. In response
to one frightened citizen's hurried inquiries,
Lieutenant Lambert said:</p>

<p>"We uns have been in just the worst fight
we ever was in before in all our born days,
and if anybody but me had been in command
the most of us would have left our bones there
behind the levee. It was awful to see the
way them Yanks fired into them women and
children."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>"But what started the rucus in the first
place?" asked the planter, who, rebel that he
was, could not believe that the blue-jackets
had turned demons all on a sudden. "What
have you Mooreville ruffians, who haven't any
business in this part of the country anyway,
been doing in the city?"</p>

<p>"You better ask what them Baton Rouge
Yankees been doing?" retorted Lambert
hotly. "We're State troops, and we've got
business in every part of the country that we
please to go; and when it pleases the Baton
Rouge people to start a nest of Yankee sympathizers
in there, it's our bounden duty to go
in and break it up. And that's just what we
have done. We've drove the enemy away,
and the Mississippi between New Orleans and
Memphis belongs to we uns once more. We'd
a' whopped 'em worse'n we did if it hadn't
been for Ike Spencer, who let his gun shoot
itself off before the rest of us were ready. I
reckon he feels kinder sneakin' over it, fur I
aint seen him since."</p>

<p>"I should think you would all feel sneaking,"
answered the planter, as he turned on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
his heel and moved away. "If you have
kicked up a row on the river I hope you will
suffer for it. We've had peace and quiet in
this part of the country for a few weeks back,
and now you have gone and brought war and
all its miseries on us again. The last one of
you ought to be hanged."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Lambert and his Home Guards
were amazed to find that this angry citizen
voiced the sentiments of all the people who
lived on the Mooreville road; and after a few
more planters had talked to them in this plain
fashion their eyes were opened to the disagreeable
fact that they had damaged their
own cause a great deal more than they had
hurt the enemy; and that if their friends and
neighbors felt the same way toward them the
fire that had been poured into their ranks by
the gunboats was nothing to what they would
have to stand when they reached home.
When they came to think it all over they were
the maddest lot of men that had ever been seen
in that part of the country. They blamed
their lieutenant for being the cause of it, and
swore at him so lustily that he fell behind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
rode alone, putting in his time by wishing a
good many heavy penalties to the address of
his one-legged friend Abner, who, after the
experience he had had with Yankees, ought
to have known better than to advise him
to "pester" the gunboats. All the Home
Guards rode slowly, so as to reach the outskirts
of Mooreville a little after nightfall, and
then they separated and slunk away toward
their respective homes like school-boys who
had been playing truant. But the news had
got ahead of them, and an indignation meeting
was being held in the dining room of the
hotel. Some of the Mooreville people, Captain
Randolph among the number, had seen
and talked with men who lived down the river
road and had heard the roar of the big guns,
and mounted messengers had been sent to the
city to learn what the firing was about. These
men, who had fast horses and went across lots,
rode all the way at top speed, and to such
good purpose that they returned to Mooreville
about two hours before the Home Guards came
straggling in; and the story they told to the
crowd at the hotel raised such a storm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
indignation that for a while things looked
serious.</p>

<p>In the meantime, and to make matters worse,
the news spread through the country round
about and armed planters came flocking in to
lend assistance in driving back the force that
was supposed to be advancing upon Mooreville;
and the climax was reached when
wagons began arriving from the direction of
the river, drawn by panting mules that had
been driven until they were almost exhausted,
and loaded with the families and household
effects of the frightened owners who were
fleeing before the invading Federals. Of
course the very meagre information these
people brought added to the excitement and
alarm, for there were not two among them
who told the same story. They expected to
find the town deserted by its inhabitants, and
were much surprised to discover that it was
not.</p>

<p>"It's no use for you fellows to think of
standing against them," exclaimed one trembling
driver, who carried in his hand a frayed
ox-gad which he had worn out over his mules'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
backs. "Butler is coming with his whole
army."</p>

<p>"Did you see them?" inquired Mr. Gray,
who had ridden in with Ned Griffin for a companion.
They were both armed, and although
they did not believe in shooting at those who
carried the Old Flag, they were ready to do
what they could to protect their homes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I saw them," replied the man
earnestly. "I hadn't left my house a quarter
of a mile behind before I discovered some of
their cavalry riding along one of my lanes. I
suppose my house is in ashes by this time."</p>

<p>"Were they burning things as they came?"
asked one of Mr. Gray's neighbors.</p>

<p>"There was the blackest smoke over toward
the river that I ever saw in my life," was the
answer. "Baton Rouge is gone up. You'd
better leave while you can. You may save
your lives, but you can't save your property.
Get along there, mule! Me and mine will
take to the brush."</p>

<p>Every story to which Mr. Gray and Ned
Griffin listened was more thrilling than the
one that came before it. Among others they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
found a man who lived in the outskirts of the
city, and who, standing in his back door, had
seen a bench which supported twenty-five
stands of bees demolished by a shell from the
gunboats. Still another had fled from his
house just in time to escape capture by Butler's
advance infantry, which was moving up the
road in platoon front; and more than that,
the highway was blue with Federals as far as
his eye could reach. Of course such tales
as these frightened some of the Mooreville
people, but Mr. Gray assured his young companion
that he put very little reliance upon
them.</p>

<p>"These folks are not responsible for what
they tell us, because they are scared out of
their wits," was what he said to Ned Griffin
more than once. "What would the Federals
gain by capturing or destroying two little
towns like Baton Rouge and Mooreville? If
there was a fort or a body of Confederate
troops here I might put some faith in these
rumors; but now I don't. When our couriers
return we shall have the straight of the story,
and not before. Have you seen anything of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
our Home Guards, who ought to be mustering
for our defence?"</p>

<p>No, Ned hadn't seen them; and when he
came to ride about the town and make inquiries
he could not find anybody else who had
seen them. The truth was they were too
badly frightened to show themselves, for they
were afraid that they might be called upon to
do something. Captain Tom's uniform was in
its old hiding place in the garret, and Tom
himself was stretched out on the lounge in his
mother's room, eager for news and dreading
to hear it, but too ill to mount his horse and
muster his men for the defence of the town.</p>

<p>At length two of the Mooreville messengers
returned, and then the citizens got "the
straight of the story." When they learned
that General Butler's army had not moved
out of New Orleans at all, that not a Federal
soldier had stepped upon the sacred soil of
Louisiana in the neighborhood of Baton Rouge
during the whole of that day, and that the
city had been shelled and partially burned
because Lieutenant Lambert of Tom Randolph's
Home Guards had tried to gain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
little cheap notoriety for himself by firing
upon an unarmed boat&mdash;when the citizens
heard this their fear give way to the wildest
rage; and if they could have got their hands
upon Lambert at that moment it is more than
probable that they would have handled him
roughly. With one accord the crowd surged
up the steps that led to the hotel porch and
through the wide hall into the dining room,
which was quickly filled with men who had
about made up their minds that the Home
Guards had made them trouble enough, and
that it would be a good plan to get rid of
them without loss of time.</p>

<p>"Of all the senseless acts I ever heard of
this last one of Lambert's is the beat," shouted
an excited individual who had perched himself
upon one of the tables. "Those Baton
Rouge people knew what they wanted, and
if it suited them to make friends with the
Yankees and trade with them we planters
have no business to find any fault with them
for it. I would have done the same thing
myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, you traitor!" shouted a voice from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the farther end of the dining room. "Would
you hold communication with the enemies of
your flag?"</p>

<p>"Yon shut up, Bill Cummings," retorted
the speaker. "If I am a traitor you're another.
You've got a sack of Federal salt and
some Federal tea and coffee hidden in one of
your corn cribs at this moment, and I can
prove it. You got them by trading a beef to
one of the gunboats down there at Baton
Rouge, and you brought them home in your
wagon at dead of night, when you thought all
your neighbors were fast asleep."</p>

<p>This raised a shout of laughter at the expense
of Bill Cummings, but no one said a
harsh word to him, for probably there were
not a dozen men in the room who would not
have been glad to get some of that salt and
tea and coffee. Mr. Gray himself was standing
in a pair of Federal brogans, and the man
next him wore a straw hat that looked exactly
like those that Uncle Sam issued to his sailors
every month.</p>

<p>"Now, then," continued the man who had
taken possession of the table, "I am in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
favor of taking that ruffian Lambert out of his
bed, if he has had time to get there, and giving
him such a whipping that he won't get
over it as long as the war lasts."</p>

<p>"Let's hang him and be done with him,"
cried another.</p>

<p>"And while we are dealing with Lambert,
don't let's forget Tom Randolph," shouted a
third.</p>

<p>"Tom Randolph is in no way to blame for
what happened at Baton Rouge," said Mr.
Gray, who was one of the few cool and reasonable
men there were in the crowd. "He has
no more authority over the Home Guards
than I have."</p>

<p>"Then I say let's lick him because he
hasn't some authority over them so that he
can make them behave themselves. What did
he organize the company for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"That is what I should like to know. Now
mark my words: there will be a Yankee garrison
in Baton Rouge in less than a week, and
then our trading will be up stump, for we
can't go there any more."</p>

<p>"That's so. What excuse has that man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Lambert for living, I'd like to know? Let's
bu'st him and the Home Guards up right here
and now."</p>

<p>Uttering wild yells of approval, with which
were mingled loud calls for ropes and dire
threats against the peace of mind and bodily
comfort of Captain Tom Randolph, the crowd
made a rush for the door, and it was several
minutes before Mr. Gray and the cool-headed
men who sided with him could make themselves
heard above the tumult.</p>

<p>"Be reasonable, gentlemen," urged the former.
"Don't let your excitement lead you
to do something you will be heartily ashamed
of and sorry for to-morrow. You cannot
touch those men in the way you suggest,
especially Tom Randolph, who is a State
officer. Whoop and yell about it all you
please," he continued, after the angry shouts
of dissent which these words called forth had
subsided, "but it is a fact that Tom holds a
commission from the Governor, and if you
put your hands on him you will go to jail to
pay for it. Confederate officers might deal
with him, though on that point I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
sure; but private citizens certainly cannot."</p>

<p>These warning words caused a dissension in
the ranks of the would-be lynchers at once,
and the hubbub that arose all over the room,
as well as from the outside, where there was a
respectable gathering that had not been able
to gain admittance to the dining hall, was
almost deafening. Mr. Gray looked troubled
as he saw his angry neighbors swaying back
and forth and shaking their clenched hands in
one another's faces, and presently he stooped
and whispered a few hasty words to Ned
Griffin, who, after a terrific struggle, managed
to work his way through the crowd to the
nearest window, by which he made his exit
from the building. He was charged with an
important duty, and he was anxious to discharge
it without loss of time; but the men
on the outside insisted on detaining him until
he told what was going on in the dining room.</p>

<p>"Honor bright, there isn't anything going
on in there that would interest you or anybody
else," declared Ned, who knew full well
that it would never do to say that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
some talk of lynching Lieutenant Lambert and
"bu'sting up" Tom Randolph. "Mr. Gray
has been quoting some law, that's all. Let me
go, please. I want to tell Mrs. Gray that the
excitement is all over."</p>

<p>The men released him and Ned made his way
to the hitching rack where he had left his horse,
mounted, and galloped off. He made a great
show of riding down the road toward Mr.
Gray's house, but as soon as he thought he
could do so without attracting attention he
turned back, and went at top speed toward the
plantation on which Lieutenant Lambert found
employment as overseer. Paying no heed to
the small army of dogs that came out to dispute
his advance he rode close to the door of the
overseer's house, there being no porch to bar
his way, and tapped lightly upon it with the
handle of his riding-whip. If he had made a
good deal of noise it is probable that he would
not have received any response from the solitary
occupant of the building, who was thoroughly
frightened at what he had done, but
totally ignorant of the fact that his life would
be in danger if Mr. Gray and his friends failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
in their efforts to control the mob at the hotel.
The cautious way in which his visitor strove
to attract his attention told him that there
was something afoot, and he thought it best to
answer.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he demanded, his voice
sounding as if it came from under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>"It's I&mdash;Ned Griffin," was the reply.
"Come to the door so that I can say a word to
you without fear of being overheard, and be
quick about it. There's not an instant to
lose."</p>

<p>This startling announcement brought Lambert
out of bed and to the door, which he
opened just wide enough to make sure that his
visitor was Ned Griffin, and nobody else; and
then he opened it so that he could put his
head out and look up and down the lane that
ran by the house to the negro quarter.</p>

<p>"I am alone," Ned assured him without
waiting to be questioned, "and I am here because
Mr. Gray sent me. Do you know what
you have done by this day's work? You have
destroyed a good portion of Baton Rouge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
got every white man in the settlement down
on you."</p>

<p>"I never&mdash;&mdash;" began Lambert, who was
profoundly astonished.</p>

<p>"I am not here to argue the matter," interrupted
Ned, "but to tell you that there is a
mob in the hotel who are talking strongly of
laying violent hands on you. They would
have been here before this time if it hadn't
been for Mr. Gray and a few others who don't
believe in such things; but the gang was about
equally divided when Mr. Gray sent me to
warn you, and you had better dig out. They
are as likely to decide on one thing as another,
and you are not safe in this house."</p>

<p>"Great smoke!" gasped Lambert when he
began to comprehend the situation. "Where
shall I go?"</p>

<p>"Get into your duds and draw a bee-line
for the nearest patch of timber. Mr. Gray
may be able to hold the mob and he may
not; so I say again that you had better dig
out."</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small smcap">Ned Griffin warning Lambert.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>"I never looked for you to be so good to
me, Ned," faltered Lambert, who seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
so dazed that he did not realize the necessity
of acting quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me; thank Mr. Gray," said
Ned hastily. "If it had not been for him
I am afraid I should have left you to look
out for yourself; for I know how you and
Tom Randolph have been working against me.
But you can't injure me now, and so I can
afford to be magnanimous. Are you going to
clear out or not?"</p>

<p>Yes, Lambert thought he had better take a
friend's advice and seek safety in flight while
the way was open to him; and when Ned heard
him say that he wheeled his horse and set off
post-haste to carry the same warning and advice
to another party whose name had that night
been rather unpleasantly mentioned in connection
with a sound thrashing. This one was Tom
Randolph, who heard his ring at the door but
lacked the courage to answer it, for something
told him that he would hear disagreeable news
if he did. Mr. Randolph answered the bell
himself, and the words he listened to almost
drove him frantic. Ned did not tell him that
the mob had threatened to whip Tom, for, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
he afterward said, he couldn't get his consent
to go as far as that; but he said enough to put
Mr. Randolph into a terrible state of mind.
He stamped his feet on the gallery, shook his
fists over his head, and wished from the bottom
of his heart that every member of the Home
Guards had been sent to the front and killed
off long ago, and then he went in to tell his
wife about it, and leave her to break the news
to Tom in any way she thought best. To say
that the young man was utterly confounded
would be putting it very mildly. He was
terribly frightened, of course, and angry as
well; but for some reason or other he did not
seem to stand so much in fear of personal
violence as he did of losing his commission.
When his mother had repeated word for word
the conversation that took place between Ned
Griffin and Mr. Randolph, and Tom had asked
a question or two, he jumped to his feet and
charged about the room like a caged wild
animal.</p>

<p>"There isn't a man in the world who has
half the trouble I do," he said, almost tearfully.
"That idiot Lambert has broken up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the company as completely as though the
Yankees had come in and captured every
member of it."</p>

<p>"And think of the misery he has brought
upon the Baton Rouge people," suggested his
mother.</p>

<p>"I don't care a picayune for the Baton
Rouge people," said Tom in savage tones.
"They ought to have known that they would
bring themselves into trouble by being so
friendly with the Yankees; but all the same
Lambert showed himself a born fool when he
fired on that gunboat. I should be glad to
see him and every man who went with him
conscripted and put where they would have to
behave themselves, if I could only get others
to fill their places; but that is something I
can't do. And if I lose my men I shall have
to throw up my commission or go into the
army. When I meet them at the enrolling
office in the morning I will talk to them in a
way they will remember."</p>

<p>But when morning dawned upon his sight
after a restless and sleepless night, the captain
of the Home Guards had several other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
things to occupy his mind. First came a committee
of twelve stalwart men appointed by
the indignant citizens of Baton Rouge, who
called at Mr. Randolph's house to inquire
what Tom meant by sending a gang of ruffians
to their peaceful city to bring destruction
upon it, and death and wounds to its quiet
inhabitants, in that wanton, useless, and outrageous
manner. The scathing denunciation
and threats that Captain Tom was obliged to
listen to before he and his mother could convince
the visitors that he was in no way to
blame for it, that he did not know the first
thing about it until it was all over, and that
the Home Guards had acted on their own
responsibility and without orders from him,
were things he never forgot; and the only
way he could pacify the committee, who
seemed determined to have revenge upon
somebody before they left town, was by
promising to turn his company over to the
conscripting officer as soon as he could get
to his office. Tom knew when he said it that
his Home Guards would refuse to be disposed
of in that way, but he was so much afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the Baton Rouge men and so anxious to see
the last of them, that he would have promised
more than that for the sake of inducing them
to leave the house.</p>

<p>Although Tom did not know it until afterward,
the committee took a little responsibility
from his shoulders by calling at Kimberly's
store before they went home and telling
Captain Roach, in the hearing of some of
the Home Guards, that if he did not at once
conscript every man who was in any way
concerned in Lambert's mad act they would
petition the Governor to remove him and put
in his place an officer who would attend to his
business. And this threat of theirs was what
brought some of the Home Guards to Captain
Tom's house, where we found them at the
beginning of the first chapter.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="small">CAPTAIN ROACH LAYS DOWN THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">As</span> soon as the Baton Rouge men with their
lowering looks and big revolvers were
fairly out of sight of the house Captain Tom,
feeling much the worse for the exciting ordeal
through which he had just passed, went into
his mother's room and flung himself down on
the lounge with the air of a man who had
nothing in the world to live for. There wasn't
another captain in the Confederacy, he told
himself, whose ambition to do something great
for his country had been balked and defeated
at every turn as his had been ever since he
took command of the Home Guards. In no
single instance that he could think of had his
men conducted themselves as he thought they
ought, or as he was sure Captain Hubbard's
Rangers would have conducted themselves if
they had been situated as the Home Guards
were, and it was a sad disappointment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
trial to him. Already he repented of his rash
promise to turn his company over to the
enrolling officer, for by such a proceeding he
would place himself right where he was before
the Governor honored him with his commission&mdash;that
is to say, without any standing at
all in the community. Now he had influence
and he was not ignorant of the fact. It was
very gratifying to his vanity to have men who
were his superiors in every point of view,
who had seldom invited him to their houses
or treated him with anything more than
ordinary civility&mdash;it was very gratifying to
have such men go out of their way to speak to
him, and to see them listen attentively while
he discussed the issues of the hour, and told
how the war ought to be conducted on the
Confederate side. The most of these men in
their hearts despised him, and Captain Tom
knew it; but they were aware that through
his intimacy with Captain Roach he was able
to hasten or postpone their conscription, just
as the humor seized him, and for this reason
thought it prudent to treat him with some
show of respect. But if he gave his company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
over to the enrolling officer, or if Captain
Roach were relieved and a new and stricter
man put in his place&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ow! <i>Ow!</i>" yelled the persecuted and
furious captain of the Home Guards when
these dispiriting reflections passed through his
mind; and with the words he sprang from the
lounge to the middle of the room, where he
swung his arms and danced about like one
demented. "No matter what I decide to do
I am in a fix. But I'll never give up my company&mdash;never
in this world. I am the biggest
toad in the puddle now and I am going to stay
that way, or else I'll go to Baton Rouge and
curry favor with the Yankees, as other good
Confederates have done to keep out of trouble.
Jeff Davis can't reach inside their lines
and take me by the collar and drag me into
his army. And as for Roach, if he gets up on
his dignity and says ugly things to me on account
of Lambert's foolishness, I'll let him
know who he is talking to. I'll report him
myself for&mdash;for incompetency and general
worthlessness. He's about as fit to be an enrolling
officer as Adam's off ox. At any rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
he shall never sit at my mother's table again,
and he can bet on that."</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Randolph, who had
done so much to help Captain Tom through his
trying interview with the Baton Rouge committee,
hastened into the room looking very
much excited and distressed.</p>

<p>"My dear," said she nervously, "I am
afraid we are going to have more trouble.
There is a score or more of Home Guards in
the road coming toward the house, and they
are talking loudly and shaking their fists at
one another as if they are very angry."</p>

<p>"I don't care if they are," shouted Captain
Tom. "I am mad too, as I have good reason
to be. Stand by me and see how I will talk
to them."</p>

<p>Money would not have induced Captain
Randolph to go out on the gallery alone to
meet his mutinous soldiers, and even with his
fearless mother at his side to support and
encourage him he felt like running back
into the house when he saw them coming
through the gate and heard their loud, angry
voices. Whether they intended to do him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
personal injury Tom never knew for certain,
though he afterward heard it hinted that they
did; but he was much gratified and relieved
to observe that they ceased all hostile demonstrations
when they saw his mother standing
by his side on the gallery; and that emboldened
him to go on with the programme he had
laid out for himself.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty lot of soldiers&mdash;a very
pretty lot indeed," was the way in which he
went at them. "I am heartily ashamed of
you and disgusted with myself to think I ever
consented to act as your commanding officer.
Do you know that you have done us and our
glorious cause more injury than Farragut ever
did? Men have been shot to death in the
Army of the Centre for doing less than you
have done, and now I am going to put you
where you will be served in the same way the
first time you misbehave yourselves. I shall
stand your foolishness no longer. The field
is the place for you, and there's where you are
going as soon as Captain Roach can send you."</p>

<p>"Cap'n Roach can't send us there, nor you
neither," shouted Lambert, who of course was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
expected to act as spokesman for the Home
Guards. "We are swore into the service
of the State, we are, and Confedrit officers
can't touch us. Didn't Bob Hubbard's
Rangers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can send you to the front to pay you for
what you did yesterday, and I will," interrupted
Captain Tom. "There are no such
useless things as States troops any longer, and
I am glad of it. Ask Captain Roach and he
will tell you that you are here only because
I asked him to let you stay, and that if the
camp of instruction we are waiting for had
been established I could have sent you there
any day I pleased. I have been standing between
you and him all along, and this is the
way you repay me, you ungrateful blackguards!
I'll teach you to play the part of
fools without my orders."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Lambert rubbed his hands nervously
together, shaking his head and swearing
softly to himself the while, and fairly ached to
make a suitable rejoinder; but the presence
of Tom's mother, of whom he had always
stood somewhat in awe, restrained him.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"We uns thought you was dead set agin
the Yankees, and that you would be sorter
glad to see them sailors made to stay on their
boats," one of the Home Guards ventured to
say at length.</p>

<p>"What business had you to think anything
of the kind?" demanded Captain Tom. "A
soldier's whole duty is to obey. He is nothing
but a machine and his captain does his thinking
for him. If I had wanted you to go to the
city and fire on those gunboats I should have
led you there myself. Lambert, you alone
are to blame for this miserable state of affairs,
and I will tell you for your satisfaction that
you have killed your chances for a lieutenant's
commission deader than a smelt. I'll
never recommend you to the Governor."</p>

<p>"By gum! I won't stand no such talk as
that!" yelled Lambert.</p>

<p>He sprang into the air and knocked his
heels together, dashed his hat upon the ground
and placed his foot upon the lower step, as if
he were about to rush up to the gallery where
Tom was standing. The latter's face grew as
white as a sheet, but he could not think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
yielding ground to a mutinous subordinate
while his mother was looking on. In an instant
the sword that hung at his side flashed
from its scabbard.</p>

<p>"I haven't drawn it without a cause," said
he, shaking the weapon over the railing almost
in Lambert's face, "and I warn you that I
shall not sheathe it with dishonor. That
is my motto, and I shall live up to it, no
matter what happens to me. Any more
such actions on your part will shut you up
in the guard-house on a bread and water
diet."</p>

<p>It is not likely that the sight of Tom's sword
or the threat which he could not have carried
out had any effect upon Lieutenant Lambert,
who was a noted rough and tumble fighter,
but a glance at the face of the resolute woman
who stood quietly on the porch above cowed
him at once. Mrs. Randolph did not say a
word, nor did she move an inch when Lambert
acted as though he was about to charge up
the steps, but there was something in her eye
that brought the angry man to his senses. He
backed away from the steps, picked up his hat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and remarked that he had always supposed
a first lieutenant had a right to harass the
enemy in any way he could; but he was rebuked
and silenced before he had uttered half
a dozen words because he forgot his manners
and addressed his commanding officer by his
Christian name.</p>

<p>Captain Tom was not slow to improve the
advantage he had gained, and the way he
scolded, threatened, and even insulted the
Home Guards would have made a regular soldier
open his eyes. He showed them that
they did wrong when they followed Lambert
to Baton Rouge without orders from their
captain, and drew so harrowing a picture of
the dangers and privations of the army life
to which they had doomed themselves by
their acts of disobedience and folly that he
frightened the bravest of them; and when he
thought he had impressed them sufficiently
he wound up by declaring that nothing short
of a solemn promise on their part to do better
in future would induce him to break the
agreement he had made with the Baton Rouge
men. If they would take orders from him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
nobody else he would stand between them
and all harm.</p>

<p>"And mark my words, this is the very last
warning I shall give you," said Captain Tom
in conclusion. "The last one of you ought to
be court-martialled and shot."</p>

<p>To his great surprise and his mother's, Lieutenant
Lambert stepped forward, assumed the
position of a soldier as near as he could get
it, touched his battered hat respectfully, and
said:</p>

<p>"We'll do it, cap'n, and there's my hand
on to it, if Miss Randolph will take it. From
this time on you're boss and don't nary one of
you forget it."</p>

<p>Lambert's object was to restore himself to
the favor of Tom's mother; and so he went on
to declare, with some emphatic language to
make it more binding, that he spoke for the
company and would take it upon himself to
see that the promise was kept. He was sure
he had succeeded in his object when Mrs. Randolph
smiled and shook hands with him over
the railing, but all the same Lambert meant
something very different from what he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Captain Tom made a life-long enemy when he
drew his sword on his second officer, and all
the latter wanted was an opportunity to show
it. Tom then dismissed his men with the assurance
that he would do the best he could for
them, and went into the house congratulating
himself on having won a complete victory.</p>

<p>"I have had the narrowest escape of my life
this morning," were the first words he said to
his mother. "The next time I come so near
to going into the army I shall go; and that
will be the last you will ever see of Tom Randolph.
Didn't I bring Lambert to time when
I drew my sword on him? He's had an idea
that he could run things to suit himself, but
I think I showed him his mistake. Of course
it will not be safe for me to go near Baton
Rouge, for I believe the citizens would mob
me; but I can't be sent to a conscript camp so
long as I have men to command, and that is
what I am figuring on now."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, and before Captain Tom
had finished telling his mother and himself
that he was well out of the scrape into which
his officious lieutenant had brought him, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
of the Home Guards rode into the yard with a
note from Captain Roach, in which the latter
requested Tom to come to his office at once on
business of the last importance. The young
man was frightened again; but the idea of
talking over matters with Captain Roach while
his mother was not by to support him was
not to be entertained for a moment. He
passed the note over to her after he had read
it, and said almost fiercely to the bearer:</p>

<p>"Tell Captain Roach that he has forgotten
himself&mdash;that I am his senior; and if he is so
anxious to see me he must come where I am.
At the present time I am not dancing attendance
upon him or anybody else."</p>

<p>"One moment, my dear," Mrs. Randolph
interposed. "A written invitation demands
the courtesy of a written reply. Permit me
to answer the captain. I will show you the
note before sending it away."</p>

<p>His mother went into the house and Captain
Tom said to the Home Guard, who sat on his
horse at the foot of the steps:</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what Roach wants of
me?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon it's something or 'nother about
them men from Baton Rouge, who acted like
they wanted to bu'st things," replied the messenger.
"Looks to me like the cap'n feels
sorter shook up over what they said to him,
and that he's got himself into some kind of a
muss that nobody but you can help him out of.
He talks like he's going to send we uns to
camp. Can you shet him off on that, do you
reckon?"</p>

<p>"It depends entirely upon the way you
Home Guards conduct yourselves from this
time on," answered Captain Tom impressively.
"Roach would have conscripted you long ago
if I hadn't stood your friend, and he may do
it yet if you follow Lambert on any more of
his crazy expeditions."</p>

<p>"I didn't foller," said the man hastily,
"and I don't want you to think I did. I was
to home all the blessed time. I aint caring to
bother the Yankees so long as they let me be.
And Lambert, he won't go off that away agin.
He was purty bad skeared last night."</p>

<p>"What at?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? Some of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
folks went down to the river yesterday to see
what all that shooting was about, and when
they come back and told what Lambert had
been a-doing, ole man Gray and the rest of 'em
was that mad that they talked of hanging
Lambert up to a tree and licking you like you
was a nigger."</p>

<p>Captain Tom reeled as if the man had
struck him with the handle of the heavy
riding whip he carried in his hand, and
grasped at the veranda railing for support.</p>

<p>"I am telling you nothing but the gospel
truth," continued the messenger, not a little
surprised at the effect his words had produced
upon his commanding officer, "and I thought
you had had time to hear all about it. They
was a tol'able mad lot of men down to the
hotel last night, and when I seen 'em going
on I was mighty glad I hadn't went with
Lambert and the rest."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that old man Gray
dared to talk of whipping <i>me</i>?" exclaimed
Tom, who could hardly believe his ears.
"Wasn't it Lambert he spoke of?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it was you; and he wasn't the only
one who spoke of it, nuther," replied the
Home Guard. "They was all mad, I tell you,
and some of them was for hanging Lambert."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness they had," said Captain
Tom, speaking before he thought. "That is
to say, I wish they had done something to
him before he brought me into all this trouble.
Was that what frightened him?"</p>

<p>"You're mighty right, and he took to the
bresh as soon as he got wind of it. But he
come out this morning and we all have
promised to stand by him. If they put a
ugly hand on one of the company we uns
allow to burn them out."</p>

<p>"That's the idea!" cried Tom, who never
would have thought of such a thing himself.
"I see very plainly that we've got to do something
to protect ourselves. We are State
troops, and if these cowardly citizens drive us
to it we will treat them as we would the
armed enemies of our country if we could
only get at them. We'll begin on old man
Gray and never let up until we've destroyed
everything he's got. No man who dares to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
threaten me and those who serve under me
shall hold up his head as high&mdash;&mdash; Sh! Here
comes my mother. Don't say a word in her
hearing, but tell Lambert I'll see him after a
while and arrange a plan of operations with
him."</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Randolph came out on the
porch with the note she had written, and
which she presented for Tom's approval. It
was not written in his name, but in her own.
She said she regretted that her son did not
feel able to accept the captain's kind invitation,
owing to the excitement and distress of
mind into which he had been thrown by the
unfortunate occurrences of the last few hours,
but if Captain Roach would honor her by
coming up to dinner at the usual hour she
hoped he would find Captain Randolph so
far recovered that he would be able to talk
over with him the very important business
to which Captain Roach had referred in his
note.</p>

<p>The result of this piece of strategy was that
an open rupture between Captain Tom and
the conscript officer was avoided; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the latter, who had been so frightened and
angered by the threats of the Baton Rouge
committee that he was several times on the
point of doing something desperate, came up
to dinner "at the usual hour," he was the
same pleasant and agreeable fellow he had
always been. But he found Captain Tom
lying on the sofa in dressing-gown and slippers,
and looking the picture of misery. Before
he advanced to take the limp palm that
Tom languidly extended he stopped in the
middle of the room and asked if someone had
been laying violent hands upon him. To be
candid he thought it would be a good thing
for Tom if the citizens would shake him up a
little.</p>

<p>"No, sir," was the very dignified reply.
"Physical pain would not do a Randolph up
in this way. It is purely mental anguish;
and my honor has been touched. I little
thought that I should ever permit living men
to talk as those Baton Rouge ruffians talked
to me this morning without promptly calling
them to account for it. But my Home Guards
were clearly in the wrong when they fired upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
that boat without my orders, so what could I
say or do?"</p>

<p>Captain Roach, who had had plenty of time
to cool off and recover his courage since he
wrote that note, smiled pleasantly, gave
Tom's hand a cordial shake, pulled up a chair,
and said that the committee had been quite as
savage with himself as they had been with his
friend Tom, and that he had thought it the
part of wisdom to comply with their demands
when he saw that they carried revolvers in
their coat-pockets, and were in just the right
mood to use them. He said that he had conscripted
all the Home Guards except Tom, as
he had agreed to do, because he did not see
how he could help himself. It would be very
little trouble for the Baton Rouge people, with
the aid of Rodney Gray's father and a score
of others whose names the captain could mention,
to keep watch of the way things were
done at the enrolling office, and if he failed to
keep his promise they would be sure to find it
out; but he had conscripted the Home Guards
conditionally. If they would behave themselves
in future and take orders from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
captain instead of their first lieutenant he
would not send them to camp until the last
minute, and not at all if he could help it; but
the first man who kicked out of the traces
would be the first to be sent to the front.
Lambert and the rest understood this perfectly,
and had agreed to be bound by his
decision.</p>

<p>"That's the idea!" cried Captain Tom,
delighted to learn that at last he had his
refractory men right where he wanted them.
"That's the way to bring mutineers to time.
There will be no more trouble of this kind, I
assure you, for I talked to some of my troops
very plainly this morning, and made Lambert
knuckle in a way that would have surprised
you if you could have seen it. Of course I
shall have to steer clear of Baton Rouge, but
I don't care much for that; although I confess
it nettles me to feel that I cannot go and
come when I please, as I have always been in
the habit of doing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph remained in the room long
enough to assure herself that the relations existing
between Captain Roach and her son had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
not been strained by the events of the morning,
and then, bestowing an approving smile
upon each, she arose and went out; whereupon
Captain Tom got upon his feet and carefully
closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>"Say!" he whispered when he came back
and resumed his position on the sofa, "did
you know that the town was in possession
of a mob last night, and that some Yankee
sympathizers among them had the impudence
to threaten me and my man Lambert?"</p>

<p>"I know all about it," replied Captain
Roach, an expression of anxiety settling on
his face. "But they were not Yankee sympathizers,
for men of that stamp would not
dare open their heads in this community.
They were as good Confederates as you or I."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe any such stuff," exclaimed
Tom. "There isn't a word of truth
in it. I know that Rodney Gray is a lowdown
private in our army (he isn't considered
worthy of a commission), but his father's
loyalty has always been suspected, and last
night he proposed that his gang of blackguards
should whip me and hang Lambert. Now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
tell you that a man who talks that way about
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Somebody has told you what isn't so,"
interrupted Captain Roach. "Such a proposition
was made last night, but Mr. Gray
would not hear to it. He and a few others
talked it down on the spot."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good thing for old Gray that
he did, and if he knows when he is watching
his own interests he will take pains to keep it
talked down," said Captain Tom fiercely. "I
was ready for him, and if you hadn't told me
what you have he would have lost some of his
buildings this very night."</p>

<p>The enrolling officer had seldom been so
surprised and startled. He looked fixedly at
Tom to see if he was in earnest, and then cried
out in alarm:</p>

<p>"Do you know what you are saying? Are
you crazy?"</p>

<p>"I know what I am saying and I am not
crazy," was Tom's answer. "I have been
threatened with a nigger's punishment, and I
never will rest easy until the man who proposed
the thing suffers for it."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"But you don't know who proposed it and
neither do I."</p>

<p>"No matter. I'll make it my business to
find out."</p>

<p>"And if you succeed are you going to burn
some buildings?"</p>

<p>"I am, most decidedly."</p>

<p>"You have fully made up your mind to
that, have you?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Please present my compliments to your
mother when she returns, and say to her that
I could not stop to dinner," exclaimed Captain
Roach, rising to his feet and reaching for his
cap.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you? Where are
you going in such a hurry?" Tom almost
gasped.</p>

<p>"I am going to my office, and the first hard
work I shall do after I get there will be to put
it out of your power to ruin yourself and your
father and mother, as you seem bent on doing,"
answered the captain; and there was a
look of quiet determination on his face that
Tom had never seen there before. "Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
you do not intend to do this incendiary work
alone (you haven't got pluck enough for
that," the captain added to himself), "so I
shall make all haste to send your men into the
army where they can't help you. They will
be the death of you if I don't."</p>

<p>"And must I let a man talk about whipping
me as if I were a nigger and never do or say
the first thing about it?" cried Tom, throwing
himself back upon the pillow and covering his
face with his hands. "I am not made of that
sort of stuff, and I did not think a Confederate
officer would advise me to such a cowardly
course."</p>

<p>"What would you call a thing in the shape
of a man who would sneak up on another's
property, in the dead of night when there was
no one to oppose him, and touch a match
to it?" exclaimed Captain Roach hotly.
"Would you call him a coward or not?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," whined Tom. "I am bound
to have revenge on the man who dared to say
that I ought to be whipped, and I won't give
up my plan."</p>

<p>"You'll have to take the consequences;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and if you don't promise right here and now
that you will be governed by me in future, I will
go out of this house and never enter it again;
and you know well enough what that means.
I am not going to let you send me to the army
in disgrace if I can help it."</p>

<p>"Sit down a minute," said Tom, seeing that
the captain stood ready to carry out his threat
to leave the house. "I don't see how the
burning of a cotton-gin or two will disgrace
you or anybody else."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do; for I have explained it to you
more than a hundred times. Mr. Gray and
some others are almost ready to report me now
for my failure to make you and your worthless
men take your chances with the other conscripts,
and the minute somebody begins to
lose property that minute I shall be ordered
away from here and into the army; and
wouldn't that put me in disgrace, I'd like
to know?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of my being captain of
the Home Guards if I can't call upon my men
to protect me?" cried Tom, who would have
given something to be alone for about five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
minutes so that he might have found relief in
a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"There isn't a bit of use in it," replied the
enrolling officer bluntly, "except that it keeps
you out of the army with my help. Your commission
gives you no authority to call upon
the members of a State organization to avenge
your supposed private wrongs."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;why don't you sit down?" repeated
Tom.</p>

<p>"I will when I have your promise, and not
before. If you have laid your plans to get me
into a muss with the Governor, I must head
you off if I can."</p>

<p>"Then I will make no effort to wipe out the
disgrace that has been put upon me as long as
you remain in town," said Tom very reluctantly.
"But after you leave I'll make some
people I know of wish they had spoken of
Captain Randolph with more respect. Now
sit down and act like yourself."</p>

<p>"You ought to go straight to Mr. Gray and
thank him; for if he and his friends had
not stood by you last night you might have
been badly treated," answered Captain Roach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
placing his cap on the table again and resuming
his seat by Tom's side. "You and I do
not want to go into the army, and you must
see that, in order to keep out of it, it will be
necessary for you to follow a different course
from the one you have marked out for yourself.
If I am reported for neglect of duty
the jig will be up with you."</p>

<p>"Then I must lie around and do nothing,
must I?"</p>

<p>"Is there anything else you can do with
safety? You can ride about the country at
the head of your Home Guards occasionally,
just to let the Union men see that you are
keeping up your organization, and after I
receive word that the camp of instruction has
been established, you can take the conscripts
there as fast as I can get them together; and
that's about all you can do."</p>

<p>"It's a dog's life compared with what I
thought a partisan's life would be," growled
Tom, "and perhaps it isn't safe for me to ride
about the country. The threats that were
made against me last night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will amount to nothing, I assure you,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
interrupted Captain Roach. "The hot-heads
who made them and who seemed to be so fierce
for a fuss are few in number, and have had
time to recover their senses since then. You
can't find a man in town who will say that he
was willing to go with the rabble last night;
and more than that, the order-loving people in
the community would not stand by and see a
mob run things to suit themselves. You saw
Lambert this morning, didn't you? Well, he
goes around as freely as he ever did, and no
one says a word to him."</p>

<p>Captain Tom thought of the compact that
Lambert and the rest of the Home Guards had
made to stand by one another in case of
trouble with the citizens, but thought it best
to say nothing about it to his friend Roach.
Of course he had to give the required promise
over and over again before the conscript officer
became satisfied of his sincerity, and he did it
with apparent willingness; but all the while
he was telling himself that the men who had
threatened to whip him as if he were a nigger,
no matter who they were, would hear from
him some day, and in a way they would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
like. It took a great load off his mind to
know that he would not be mobbed as soon as
he showed himself in Mooreville. In fact it
cured his "excitement and distress of mind"
in a very few minutes; and when his mother
returned at the end of half an hour he had
discarded his gown and slippers, and was
sitting up dressed in his full uniform.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">A PERPLEXING SITUATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">When</span> Captain Roach went to his office
that evening, after the best dinner he
had ever eaten in that house, Tom Randolph
rode down with him; and before he had gone
half a mile was able to tell himself that he
had been borrowing trouble and without
reason. He saw no coldness whatever in the
greetings of those he met along the road, and
the few who stopped to speak with him about
the occurrences of the previous day declared
with one accord that they did not lay any
blame at his door; but the way they denounced
and threatened Lieutenant Lambert
was a pleasant thing for Tom to hear.</p>

<p>"That man's election wasn't legal any
way," was what Tom always said in reply.
"But because I have permitted him to act as
my second in command he has somehow got it
into his head that he is a bigger man than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
am, and has a right to do as he pleases. If
he has at last found out that I know a trifle
more than he does, and that it is a soldier's
place to wait for orders from his superior, it
will be a good thing for Lambert. If the
Baton Rouge people want those gunboats
driven away from their town and will send
me word, I will go down and do the work for
them as it ought to be done."</p>

<p>Tom knew that he was quite safe in talking
in this lofty way, for he had learned during
his interview with the committee that the
people of Baton Rouge would not look kindly
upon or support any effort that was made to
drive the boats away. As long as they were
let alone the Yankees were not unpleasant
fellows to have around. They put good food
into the mouths of some of the city people,
good hats and shoes on their heads and feet,
and good money in their pockets, and were on
the whole more desirable neighbors than their
own enlisted men would have been, for the
latter had nothing to give in exchange for
garden produce and milk and butter and eggs.
But the energetic manner in which they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
to work to scatter Lambert's Home Guards
proved that these peaceable gunboat men were
ready to fight at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Captain Tom's courage and importance came
back to him rapidly when he found that the
situation was by no means as serious as he had
supposed it to be; and when he saw that even
Lambert was willing to acknowledge his authority,
he came to the conclusion that that
indignation meeting at the hotel, and the visit
of the Baton Rouge committee, were the best
things that could have happened to him and
the Home Guards. He found Lambert in his
usual loafing place in Kimberly's store. Indeed
the man was afraid to go very far away
from there, for there was no telling what
might be said and done against him if he
should absent himself. He saluted Captain
Tom respectfully, and followed him out of the
back door in obedience to a motion of his
finger.</p>

<p>"Look here, lieutenant," said Tom, when
they were alone together, "I do not in the
least blame you for saying that you would
like to see Rodney Gray's father burned out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
to pay him for what he said against you last
night, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Somebody's been a-lying on me," exclaimed
Lambert, looking alarmed. "I never
said no such stuff."</p>

<p>"Oh, what is the use of denying it to a
friend?" said Tom, with most unbecoming
familiarity. "But I don't ask whether you
intend to burn him out or not. What I want
to say is, that you must on no account think
of it so long as Captain Roach stays here. If
you do you will get him into trouble with the
Governor, and he will pay you for it by sending
you and all the men to the front."</p>

<p>"And you too?" asked Lambert.</p>

<p>"He can't conscript a commissioned officer,
can he?" said Tom, in reply. "No, he can't
do that; and if you will promise that you will
never do another thing without my express
orders, I will see that he doesn't conscript
you, either."</p>

<p>"All right, cap'n. I knuckle to you.
That's what I said this morning, and I meant
it. I'll move when you say the word and not
before."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>"If you had made that sensible resolution
long ago you would have saved yourself and
me from insult," said Tom, looking at his lieutenant
as if he would like to give him another
piece of his mind. "If you have learned that
I am the head of the company I am glad of it;
but if you want to do anything to old man
Gray on your own hook&mdash;on your own hook, I
said&mdash;why, that is a matter with which I have
nothing to do. However, you must wait until
Roach leaves Mooreville."</p>

<p>So saying, Captain Tom saluted and went
into the office. When the door closed behind
him Lambert shook both his clenched hands
at it, and said through his tightly shut
teeth:</p>

<p>"That's a matter you have nothing to do
with, is it? Well, I reckon it is; and you
don't get Sile Lambert into a furse with no
such oily words as them. I know what you
want mighty well, but I just aint a-going to
do it. You can pester ole man Gray yourself
if you feel like it, and when the job is done
I'll tell him where to find the chap who done
it. I'll learn you to keep my commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
from me and pull a sword on me besides, the
way you done this morning. By gum! If I
wasn't afeared I'd go and make friends with
the Yankees the way the Baton Rouge folks
do. I'll risk it any way before I will let myself
be conscripted."</p>

<p>Having weathered this storm without suffering
very much damage except so far as his
feelings were concerned, and quiet having been
restored in the community, Captain Tom
settled back into his old lazy way of passing
the time, and waited for something exciting to
happen. The first news out of the ordinary
that came to his ears was that Baton Rouge
had been occupied by Federal troops, much to
the gratification of the citizens, both Union and
Confederate, who experienced so delightful a
sense of security when they saw the blue-coats
on their streets that they forgot all about the
Mooreville Home Guards, and never took the
trouble to inquire whether they had been conscripted
or not. But Captain Roach looked
grave, and well he might. He had issued an
order to the effect that those he had conscripted
must report at his office at least once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
in every twenty-four hours to show that they
were still on hand and ready to receive marching
orders; but on the day the news came
that the Yankees had garrisoned the city, only
fifteen out of forty-five presented themselves.
Two-thirds of their number had left home
and friends behind and sought refuge in the
city.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty state of affairs," exclaimed
Tom, when Captain Roach told him
of it. "Those men are not worthy to be
called Southerners. Before I would show myself
so cowardly I would go somewhere and
hang myself. What will you do with them
when they come back?"</p>

<p>"They'll not come back," replied the enrolling
officer. "They will stay where they
are safe, and no doubt desertions will be of
daily occurrence as long as the Yankees
remain in the city."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be a good plan for me to go
down there and harass them by driving in
their pickets now and then?" inquired Tom.
He did not know exactly what was meant by
driving in an enemy's pickets, but he had read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
in the papers that it was often done by the
soldiers in both armies.</p>

<p>"What good would it do?" asked Captain
Roach.</p>

<p>"Why, the enemy wouldn't stay where they
were bushwhacked every time they showed
themselves, would they? A few determined
men could torment them as the buffalo gnats
torment our stock."</p>

<p>"You must be a lunatic or take me for
one," was what Captain Roach said in reply.
"Why can't you be content to let the Yankees
alone so long as they are willing to let us
alone? If you should fire on their pickets
they would send their cavalry all through the
country about here, and there's no telling how
much damage they would do."</p>

<p>"Do you think they have brought cavalry
with them?" cried Tom, a most alarming
thought suggesting itself to him at the moment.</p>

<p>"Why, of course. They want to know what
is going on outside the city, don't they? And
how are they to find out except through their
cavalry? You may see blue-coats in Mooreville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
before sundown. You stay at home and
mind your business, for I hope to have use for
you presently."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you hope to send me off
with some conscripts?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean. I shall have to report
these desertions, and perhaps it will open
the eyes of the State enrolling officer to the
fact that he ought to have had that camp of
instruction in full blast long ago."</p>

<p>"But suppose a squad of Yankee cavalry
should intercept me on the road?" said Tom
in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>"Then you would have to fight, that's all.
If you whipped them it would be a fine thing
for you and might lead to promotion. If they
whipped you they would release your prisoners
and take you and your men away with
them."</p>

<p>"And then they would send me up North,
and I might not see home again for long
years," faltered Tom; and everyone in the
office saw that he was badly frightened at the
prospect.</p>

<p>"Exactly. You took your chances on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
when you accepted your commission, you
know. Now, I wish you to go to work on
your men and see that they are in some sort of
shape when marching orders come. There will
be guards at the camp, and I hope your company
will not suffer in comparison with them."</p>

<p>Captain Tom saw very clearly that his
connection with the Home Guards was not
likely to keep him entirely out of reach of
the dreaded Yankees; and when he looked
through the open door and his gaze rested
upon an acquaintance of his who happened to
be passing at that moment, another alarming
thought forced itself upon him. It was Ned
Griffin, and he was mounted on one of Mr.
Gray's blooded horses. He smiled pleasantly
at Tom, nodded to the Home Guards clustered
about the door, and looked on the whole as
though he felt well satisfied with himself and
with his lot in life. Not only was he comfortably
settled as overseer on one of Mr. Gray's fine
plantations, but there was no possible chance
that he would ever be forced into the army
against his will; and that was more than Captain
Randolph could say for himself.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>"How I should enjoy knocking that beggar
out of his saddle," said the latter under his
breath. Then he bent over and whispered some
earnest words into the ear of the enrolling officer.
"Look here, Roach," said he, "will you
do me the favor to keep the date of marching
a secret from everybody except myself."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to if you wish it, but I don't
see how I can," said the captain in surprise.
"I shall have to notify the conscripts themselves,
won't I? And if they choose to publish
it, as undoubtedly they will in order to
give their friends opportunity to come to the
office and bid them good-by, how am I going
to hinder it? What difference does it make
to you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It may make all the difference in the
world," whispered Tom. "That fellow who
just rode by would ask nothing better than to
send or take word to the Yankees where they
could capture me and a squad of conscripts on
a certain day."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the captain. "If he
does that I'll arrest him and ship him off to
Richmond."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>"But would that make a free man of me?"
demanded Tom impatiently. "And how are
you going to prove it on him?"</p>

<p>"That's so; and when it comes to that I
don't suppose Griffin is the only one about
here who would be glad to see you and all the
Home Guards packed off to a Northern prison.
The only thing you can do is to look out for
yourself. Take as big a squad with you as
you can muster, and stand ready to fight your
way."</p>

<p>Captain Tom was almost disheartened, but
made one more effort to shirk the duty to
which, until this particular morning, he had
looked forward with the liveliest anticipations
of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Can't you ask the Confederate authorities
to send regular troops here to act as guards,
and leave me at home to protect the town?"
said he desperately. He knew it was a confession
of cowardice on his part, but he did
not care a snap for that.</p>

<p>"Protect the town!" said Captain Roach
in great disgust. "No, I can't. Yes, on
second thought, I can; but it will end in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
you and the Home Guards being sent to the
front."</p>

<p>The captain spoke impatiently and jerked
a sheet of paper toward him on the desk, intimating
by the action that he could not
waste any more time with his friend Tom just
then, and the latter walked out of the office,
mounted his horse, and rode slowly homeward.
Something was forever happening to upset his
plans, and this last trouble was all the fault of
that man Lambert. If he had not fired upon
that unarmed boat the Federals would never
have thought it necessary to send a force to
Baton Rouge, and Captain Tom could have
escorted his conscripted neighbors to the camp
of instruction without fear of coming in contact
with the blue-coated cavalry. He would
have had many opportunities to show his fine
sword and uniform to soldiers from other parts
of the State, and could have talked as big
as he pleased about whipping iron-clad gunboats
in a fair fight. He had hoped to gain
admirers among the officers stationed at the
camp, and perhaps he could have himself recommended
to fill the commanding officer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
place when the latter was ordered to take the
field.</p>

<p>"But that's all past and gone now," said
Tom as he saw these bright hopes disappearing
like the river mists before the rising sun.
"If the Yankee cavalry blocks my way, as
it surely will if Ned Griffin gets a chance to
send them word, I just know I shall be captured,
for I can't expect raw troops like my
Home Guards to stand against veterans. I
wish Lambert had been hanged before he fired
on that boat. Who are these, I wonder?
Strangers; and spies, I'll bet."</p>

<p>This was another thought that troubled him,
and if there had been a branch road that Tom
could have turned into he would have taken
it rather than meet the two civilians he saw
riding toward him. But there was no escape
and so he kept on his way; and as he drew
nearer to them his eyes began to open wider
and an expression of amazement came to his
face. He recognized the horses they rode and
the clothes they wore, and finally it dawned
upon him that the tanned and weather-beaten
countenance of one was familiar, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
boy to whom it belonged had grown wonderfully
tall and broad-shouldered since he last
saw him&mdash;so much so, in fact, that his clothes
were too small for him. If there was any
doubt in Captain Randolph's mind it vanished
when a cheery voice called out:</p>

<p>"Hallo, Tom&mdash;ee!"</p>

<p>Tom knew the voice and the odious name by
which he had been addressed. It was the one
with which his mother used to summon him
into the house in the days gone by&mdash;with a
shrill rising inflection on the last syllable.
His first thought was to take no notice of the
greeting or to make an angry rejoinder; but
he remembered in time that he had stood in
fear of this same boy when he was several
pounds lighter than he was now. He looked
quite formidable as he sat on his horse, and
no doubt during his fifteen months in the
army had come in contact with some rough
characters, and gained experience and skill in
no end of rough and tumble fights; so Tom
thought it wise to be civil.</p>

<p>"Rodney," he exclaimed, extending his
hand with a great show of cordiality. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
don't know how glad I am to see you back
safe and sound. How long have you been at
home?"</p>

<p>"Just three days," answered Rodney Gray,
for it was he. "And this is my old schoolmate,
Dick Graham, who lives in Missouri
when he lives anywhere. But at present he is
just staying wherever night overtakes him."</p>

<p>Dick and Tom shook hands, and the latter
continued:</p>

<p>"How do you like soldiering? I suppose
you have seen some pretty rough times in the
army."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but nothing compared with what
some have seen. Dick and I have brought our
usual number of legs and arms back with us,
but many of our comrades were not so lucky.
Doing anything for your country these days?"</p>

<p>Tom's common-sense, if he had any, ought
to have told him that it would not do for him
to exaggerate his achievements in the presence
of Rodney Gray, who knew him of old, and
had seen so much more service than he had,
but he counted a good deal on Rodney's
ignorance and Dick's. They had done all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
their campaigning in the interior, had never
seen the Mississippi River during their term
of service except when they crossed from
Arkansas to Tennessee to join the Army of
the Centre, and perhaps had not had a chance
to read a newspaper for six months, and so he
thought he could say what he pleased and they
would believe it; but he reckoned without his
host.</p>

<p>"I have been very busy since I took command
of the Home Guards," he said, in answer
to Rodney's question. "I don't suppose I
have smelled quite as much powder as you
have, but I have been in some pretty hard
battles all the same."</p>

<p>"Why, I hadn't heard of it," said Rodney,
looking surprised.</p>

<p>"No, I don't imagine you had opportunity
to read the papers very often, but I thought
perhaps your father had said something about
it in his letters. I have whipped two heavy
iron-clad men-of-war&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two which?" exclaimed Dick, while Rodney
opened his eyes and looked still more
surprised.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Tom repeated the words and was
going on to tell about the fights with the gunboats
when Rodney interrupted him with:</p>

<p>"Did those vessels belong to the upper or
lower fleet?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Tom. "But they
came up from New Orleans."</p>

<p>"Then they were not iron-clads; you may
rest assured of that."</p>

<p>"Don't I know an iron-clad when I see it?"
cried Tom angrily. "I have it from good
authority that the armor on their sides was
eleven inches thick, and that there were four
feet of solid oak back of that."</p>

<p>"Great Moses!" ejaculated Dick. "There
isn't a vessel in the Yankee navy that could
carry such a load as that. Farragut has done
all his brilliant fighting with old wooden
ships, and there are no iron-clads in his fleet
unless they have come to him since he ran
past Forts Jackson and St. Philip."</p>

<p>"That's so," assented Rodney. "There
isn't an iron-clad on the river except those
with which the Yankees demolished our fleet
in front of Memphis."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"How does it come that you land soldiers
know so much about what is going on here on
the river?" demanded Captain Tom, who was
very much astonished at the extent of Rodney's
information and Dick's.</p>

<p>"Oh, we've had chances to read the papers
now and then," replied the latter.</p>

<p>"And while we were about it we read both
sides," chimed in Rodney. "Our officers
didn't like to have us do it, because the Yankee
papers tell the truth, while our own do
not scruple to lie outrageously when things
go against us."</p>

<p>Captain Tom did not know what answer to
make, for he had never expected to hear Confederate
veterans talk like that. He began
to have a suspicion that they were traitors at
heart, but he prudently kept his thoughts to
himself.</p>

<p>"How long do you remain at home?" he
asked at length.</p>

<p>"Just as long as I have a home to shelter
me," answered Rodney. "And when the
Yanks come in here and burn it down, as they
probably will sooner or later, I shall take to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the woods. I am sick and tired of the service
and I don't care who knows it. I tell you, I
felt sorry for the poor fellows I saw in Camp
Pinckney, for I know what is before them and
they don't."</p>

<p>"Were they prisoners?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, yes; but they didn't go by that
name. They were called conscripts."</p>

<p>"Why, how far is that camp from here?"
said Tom, wondering if it was the place to
which Captain Roach would forward his conscripts
when the orders came.</p>

<p>"About 7000 miles," replied Dick. "At
least I thought it was that far before we covered
the distance that lies between its stockade
and Rodney's home."</p>

<p>"It's about sixty miles, as near as I can
judge," said the latter. "Haven't you and
what's his name&mdash;Roach?&mdash;raised men enough
to fill up a squad yet? Father says you have
been working at it for a good while."</p>

<p>"Captain Roach has mustered some men,
but has had no orders to forward them. In
fact I don't think he knows that the camp of
instruction has been established."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's going to take them there when
they are ready to go?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Tom proudly; and an instant
afterward he felt as though he had signed his
own death warrant. There was no chance for
him to back out now. He couldn't be taken
suddenly ill or send Lambert in his place&mdash;he
would have to go with the conscripts himself;
for that was what he in his haste said he
intended to do, and if he did not keep his
promise this old enemy and rival of his would
publicly brand him as a coward.</p>

<p>"You are? You are going to take the conscripts
to the camp of instruction with your
Home Guards?" cried Rodney, his face becoming
radiant when he thought of the obstacles
in the shape of blue-coated soldiers
that Captain Tom might possibly find in his
way. "Hey-youp! That will be nuts for the
Yanks, won't it, Dick?"</p>

<p>"You bet. There's tolerable many Yanks
scattered around through the woods, and like
as not your friend will have the pleasure of
meeting some of them."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that they are scouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
between here and the camp?" exclaimed Tom,
who was almost ready to drop when he heard
his worst fears confirmed in this positive way.</p>

<p>"We don't mean anything else," answered
Rodney. "We ought to know, for we ran
into a squad of them on the way home."</p>

<p>"What did they do to you?" inquired
Tom, who did not know whether to believe it
or not.</p>

<p>"Nothing. They just covered us with their
carbines and told us to come in out of the rain,
and we came."</p>

<p>"Humph! Why didn't you fight or run?"</p>

<p>"Well, seeing that we had no weapons we
couldn't fight; and we know by experience
that when a Yank points a gun at you and
tells you to move over on his side the line, you
had better move."</p>

<p>"But how did you escape?"</p>

<p>"We didn't escape. We showed them our
discharges, and when they told us to git, we
got. Oh, they were gentleman, high up."</p>

<p>"Top-notch," assented Dick.</p>

<p>"I never yet saw a Yankee who was a
gentleman," sneered Tom.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here," exclaimed Dick, who had
heard a good deal about Tom Randolph and
learned to dislike him before he ever met him;
"have you much of an acquaintance with
live Yanks&mdash;I mean with those who wear uniforms?"</p>

<p>Tom was obliged to confess that he had not.</p>

<p>"Well, we've seen and talked with a few
and may be supposed to know something
about them; and when we say that the squad
who captured us, and might have made us
trouble but didn't, were gentlemen, we mean
it. If we ever find one of them in a box and
see a chance to help him out, we intend to improve
it."</p>

<p>"But as you have no discharge to show, you
had better not permit yourself to fall into
their hands while you have that uniform on,"
said Rodney. "By gracious! It makes my
old hat rise to think how I should feel if I
knew I was going to be ordered off to that
camp with a lot of conscripts. You will lose
your prisoners sure, and your Home Guards
will be brushed aside like so many cobwebs.
If you get through with a whole skin we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
call you a good one. We'd better be riding
along, Dick."</p>

<p>"Now you've done it," said the latter, as
he and Rodney moved on and left Tom out of
hearing. "You have frightened him out of
his wits."</p>

<p>"With your help I think I have given him
a good scare," was Rodney's answer. "I'll
bet you a month's wages in good and lawful
money of the Confederacy that Tom Randolph
never takes a squad of conscripts to Camp
Pinckney. I know I shouldn't hanker after
the job if I were in his place."</p>

<p>As to Tom himself, he was about as badly
frightened as he could be without becoming
frantic, and much against his will he was
obliged to tell himself that there was but one
course of action open to him. If it was true
that Federal scouting parties had thrown
themselves between Mooreville and Camp
Pinckney, he must run the fearful risk of being
killed or captured by them, or else he
must resign his commission, exchange his fine
uniform for a citizen's suit and take the position
of overseer on his father's plantation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Tom wanted to yell when this alternative presented
itself to him. An overseer was on a
par with a blacksmith or a carpenter or a
clerk in a store. He had to work for his living
and was in consequence a nobody. And
Tom remembered how he had railed at Ned
Griffin when he accepted Mr. Gray's offer, declaring,
in the hearing of everyone who would
listen to him, that nobody but a poltroon
would take that way of keeping out of the
service.</p>

<p>"And now I've got to come to it myself or
get shot," whined Tom. "It will be an awful
come down for a man who has held a commission
in the service of the State, but unless
mother can see some other way out I shall
have to do it."</p>

<p>Captain Tom wound up by wishing that
every man who was in any way responsible
for the war might always feel as miserable as
he felt at that moment.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">HOUNDS ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">"Why</span>, Tom, what has happened to make
you look so pale and haggard?" anxiously
inquired Mrs. Randolph, as the perplexed
and discouraged captain of the Home
Guards drew rein before the door and rolled
out of his saddle instead of dismounting in his
usual soldier-like fashion. "Are you ill, or
have you heard some terrible news?"</p>

<p>"Both," replied Tom, giving his horse a
slap to start him toward the stable, and afterward
throwing himself down upon one of the
steps that led up to the porch. "Who do
you suppose has come back to town to worry
and torment me?"</p>

<p>"I hope it isn't Rodney Gray," said his
mother, who had not forgotten that the Barrington
boy had been elected to office and
presented with a sword by Bob Hubbard's
Rangers, while her son was left in the ranks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Although she never said so out loud, she had
indulged in the hope that something might
happen to keep Rodney away from Mooreville
as long as the war lasted. She knew that
he had faced the Yankees in a good many
hard battles, and, being a veteran, of course he
would crow over Tom, who was nothing but a
Home Guard.</p>

<p>"Well, it is Rodney Gray, and nobody
else," said Captain Randolph, in a tone of intense
disgust. "He looks as though he had
been living on the fat of the land, for the citizen's
clothes he discarded when he went into
the army are much too small for him. He has
brought with him a comrade who lives in Missouri
and who, I judge, is waiting for a chance
to get over the river; and he's about the most
impudent chap I ever talked to. He knows
more about gunboats than I who have been in
battle with them."</p>

<p>"Have you not learned that those who are
the most conceited generally know the least?
But you are not obliged to associate with
them, and besides you can't; for you are an
officer and they were nothing but privates."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that, and I did not at all like the
familiar way in which they talked to me.
They gave me bad news. They were captured
by Federal cavalry while they were coming
home."</p>

<p>"Tom!" exclaimed Mrs. Randolph, who
was much surprised and alarmed to hear it,
"do you mean to say that our enemies are
scouting through the country?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean; and if you have any
valuables you don't want to lose, you had
better be taking care of them."</p>

<p>"That is what I think. How did Rodney
manage to escape?"</p>

<p>"He didn't escape. The Yankees read his
discharge and let him go free. And that chum
of his, Dick Graham, says they were gentlemen,
and if he ever sees one of them in a scrape
he will help him out if he can. And they are
both tired of the war and don't mean to go
back to the army. The way they talked was
shameful, and I will speak to Roach about it
the very next time I go to the office."</p>

<p>Tom then went on to repeat the conversation
that had taken place between himself and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
returned veterans, and by the time he got
through his mother was as deeply perplexed
and as badly frightened as he was. Two
things were plain to her: Rodney and Dick
were traitors at heart, and ought to be arrested
and imprisoned before they had time to talk
to any of the conscripts as they had talked to
Tom, and the other was that her son could not
take a squad of men to the camp of instruction
and run the risk of being captured by the
Federal troopers.</p>

<p>"Now that I have had time to think of it,
I don't care whether they are shut up or not,"
answered Captain Tom. "If they are permitted
to run loose in the settlement and to
talk to the conscripts as they did to me, they
may frighten them into deserting to Baton
Rouge; and in that case, don't you see, there
wouldn't be any men for anybody to guard to
the camp of instruction. But if a squad is
sent there I am bound to go in command of the
escort; I don't see how I can get out of it, for
I told Rodney that I was going."</p>

<p>"What of that? Why can't you send Lambert,
or let Captain Roach go in your place?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>"If you can think of any excuse I can offer
for not going I shall be delighted to hear it,"
replied Tom. "But if I back out after what I
have said about Ned Griffin's cowardice and
all that, Rodney Gray will never let me hear
the last of it. I haven't said much to you
about it, but all the returned soldiers laugh
every time my name is mentioned in their
hearing, and make sport of the Home Guards
because they are willing to acknowledge me
as their commander; and I believe that is one
thing that makes them so ready to rebel whenever
I issue an order they don't like. Of
course Rodney will be the worst of all, for he
never liked me."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear boy, you are in a predicament,
that's a fact," exclaimed Mrs. Randolph,
who had never dreamed that the situation was
as bad as this. She knew that Tom would not
see a minute's peace if he gave the common
people of Mooreville, especially such low
fellows as the returned veterans and those
who composed the rank and file of the
Home Guards, any reason for believing that
he was lacking in courage. "What can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
you do? Have you decided upon anything?"</p>

<p>"I have not. That is something you will
have to do for me. As far as I can see there
are but two courses of action open to me: I
must either take the conscripts to camp
and take my chances on being shot or captured&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Tom, I'll never consent to that," exclaimed
his mother, almost tearfully. "You
had much better follow young Griffin's example.
Your father and I can arrange all
that by sending Larkin into the army and
putting you in his place."</p>

<p>Larkin was Mr. Randolph's overseer; and
he had not been conscripted by Captain
Roach because his employer had claimed
exemption for him. Mr. Randolph supposed,
and so did his wife, that Tom was provided for
as long as the war continued; and as it was
necessary that they should have an overseer
they decided that Larkin would do as well as
anybody else, and Tom's father had entered
into a verbal contract to purchase his freedom
by providing the hundred pounds of bacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and beef demanded by the Confederate Government.
They would not have done such a
thing if they had had the least suspicion that
Tom's position as captain of the Home Guards
was likely to bring him into contact with the
Yankees.</p>

<p>"That is the only alternative," said Tom.
"I must face death or confinement in a Northern
dungeon, or I must send my resignation to
the Governor at the new capital. But I am
afraid Larkin will demand a larger bounty
than father will be willing to pay."</p>

<p>"Your father will not give him a penny
with my consent," said Mrs. Randolph very
decidedly. "He is a hireling, and his wishes
will not be consulted. He will simply be
discharged; that is all there is of it."</p>

<p>"But he is obstinate and hard to deal with,
and perhaps he will refuse to go before his
year is out," suggested Captain Tom.</p>

<p>"In times like these civil contracts are not
worth the paper they are written on," said
his mother, in a tone which seemed to imply
that she had already determined upon some
course of action. "There are some hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
hands on this plantation, and if your father
should find it impossible or inconvenient to
pay, within twelve months, the eighty thousand
pounds of meat which the Confederate
Government will demand as the price of Larkin's
exemption, then what? I think myself
that Larkin will take to the woods before he
will go into the army."</p>

<p>"I don't care where he goes so long as he
gets out of my way," declared Captain Tom.
"I don't know what our neighbors will think
of me when they see me in the field with
a gang of niggers, but I can't discover any
other way out of the difficulty; can you?"</p>

<p>"At present I cannot; but I would much
rather know that you were safe in the field and
within sound of the dinner-horn, than to fear
that you were in danger of being shot or captured.
Perhaps we had best let the subject rest
where it is until I have had time to ask your
father what he thinks about it. I will tell you
our decision to-morrow; and meanwhile don't
commit yourself. There goes the bell."</p>

<p>It was the call to dinner and Captain Tom
answered it, although he did not have much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
appetite for the things he found on the table.
His father had of late got out of the way of
asking his son if he had heard any news in
town, but when the latter remarked that he
had met and talked with Rodney Gray that
morning, and that Rodney and his companion
had been captured by the enemy while on
the way home, Mr. Randolph took interest
enough in the matter to inquire into the particulars,
and to ask Tom if he didn't think he
would run some risk in taking conscripts to
camp.</p>

<p>"Risk!" repeated Captain Tom. "You
may well say that. Roach thinks I will have
to fight my way, and so does Rodney. He
said in so many words that I would be sure
to lose my prisoners, that the Home Guards
would be brushed out of the way like
cobwebs, and if I got through with a whole
skin he would call me a good one. Risk!
I should think so. It's positively dangerous!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't want to go, there is one
way you can get out of it," replied Mr. Randolph,
as he folded his napkin and pushed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
chair back from the table. "You can throw
up your commission."</p>

<p>"I have thought of resigning," said Tom;
and he had half a mind to broach the subject
of Larkin's discharge then and there, but
finally concluded that he would leave it to
his mother.</p>

<p>"As far as I am concerned, I shall be glad
to see you a civilian once more, and to know
that I shall never put eyes on that sword and
uniform again," continued Mr. Randolph.
"The Southern people are all fools, and a
year ago I was one of the most senseless of
them."</p>

<p>"Does that mean that you have given up
the hope of Southern independence?" inquired
Tom, who was not greatly surprised,
although he had never heard his father talk
in this way before.</p>

<p>"It means that we have made beggars of
ourselves by trying to break up the government
when we had no earthly excuse for it.
We were never short of anything before, and
now I am put to my stumps to find paper to
write on and salt for my table. There will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
no bacon and hams for us next winter unless I
can induce some of my friends to do a little
trading in Baton Rouge for me. I dare not go
into the city to do it for myself, for you are
captain of the Home Guards. I wish in my
soul that I had had a guardian appointed over
me about the time I was making such an idiot
of myself on account of that company."</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph rubbed some "nigger twist"
between his palms, jammed it rather spitefully
into an earthen pipe with a cane stem, and
went out on the gallery to enjoy his after-dinner
smoke. He was a rich planter, and it
was not so very long ago that his crop of
cotton was worth a fortune to him every year;
but he could not smoke cigars now unless they
were given to him. Some of his neighbors
who had not taken so deep an interest in the
Home Guards, Rodney Gray's father for one,
had passes that took them in and out of Baton
Rouge as often as they chose to make use of
them; and these men had salt and tea and
coffee, stockings and shoes and cigars in
abundance, and "plenty of greenback money,
too," as one darkey affirmed, who chanced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
catch a momentary glimpse of the inside of
Mr. Gray's pocket-book.</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph made his exit from the room
through one of the low windows that opened
upon the veranda, sat down long enough to
take a dozen or more pulls at his pipe, and
then came back to say:</p>

<p>"Tom, you want to be kinder careful what
you tell about Rodney Gray and his folks, for,
if we work matters right, I am sure Gray will
lend me a helping hand now and then; and
goodness knows I need it bad enough. I
suspicion that in some way or other he has
got on the blind side of the Yankees in Baton
Rouge."</p>

<p>"Then he ought to be reported to our
authorities," said Mrs. Randolph spitefully.</p>

<p>"That's what I say!" exclaimed Captain
Tom. "If he is giving aid and comfort to
the enemy he is breaking our laws; and I
say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your horses," interrupted his father.
"What is the use of cutting off your nose to
spite your face? Instead of giving aid and
comfort to the Federals, he is working them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
so that they are giving much aid and comfort
to him and a few others who are in the ring
with him."</p>

<p>"And is it your desire to become one of that
'ring,' as you call it?" demanded his wife,
pitching her voice in a little higher key than
usual. "Would you collogue with the enemies
of your country for the sake of making
something out of them? Mr. Randolph&mdash;George&mdash;I
am surprised to hear you hint at
such baseness; and in the presence of a prominent
State officer, too."</p>

<p>"Hold your horses," said Mr. Randolph
again. "If I can make something to eat
and wear by trading with the Yankees, who
seem to have enough and to spare, it is to my
interest and yours to do it, is it not? And
through it all I can still be a good Confederate,
can't I? Look here," he continued,
walking up to the table and sinking his voice
almost to a whisper. "I have 200 bales
of cotton concealed in the swamp, and Gray
has more than twice as much. And every
bale of that cotton is worth sixty cents a
pound in New York."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Randolph straightened up and looked
at his wife and son as much as to say, "What
do you think of that?" He expected them to
be surprised, and certainly he was not disappointed.
For a minute or two they were so
amazed that they could not speak.</p>

<p>"Six&mdash;did I understand you to say <i>sixty</i>
cents a pound?" Captain Tom managed to ask
at last.</p>

<p>"Where did you hear that ridiculous
story?" chimed in Mrs. Randolph. "I have
read the papers very closely, and I didn't see
anything of it."</p>

<p>"Do you for a moment imagine that our
lying papers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph&mdash;George!"</p>

<p>"Hold your horses. I know what I am
talking about. It is a fact that our papers
conceal everything that goes against us, or
make light of it, and of course they wouldn't
say that cotton is bringing sixty cents in the
North while in the Confederacy it is worth
only seven. If our papers should publish such
reports as that, don't you see that the Confederacy
wouldn't get any more cotton? Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
planter who owns a bale would make haste to
run it into the swamp."</p>

<p>"If I had any cotton I would rather give it
to our government for three cents than to our
enemies for twenty times as much," declared
Captain Tom, who, seeing that he did not possess
a pound of the commodity in question,
could afford to be very patriotic. He looked
at his mother, expecting to hear her say that
she would do the same; but she gazed down
at her plate and said nothing. Sixty cents a
pound! Reckoning each bale at 450 pounds
that would make her husband's concealed
cotton worth about $54,000, <i>if</i> it could only
be placed in the hands of the Yankees
without being confiscated. But there was
the rub.</p>

<p>"Tom, you always were about half-witted,"
exclaimed his father, who was so angry that
he spoke without thinking. "I would rather
have sixty cents in greenback money than four
dollars in Confederate scrip any day; and I
don't see the use of your talking in that senseless
way."</p>

<p>"But your cotton is in the swamp, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
are you going to get it to New York?" asked
Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"And how do you know that you and the
darkeys who helped you put it there are the
only ones who know where it is?" chimed in
Tom. "The Lincoln hirelings have been stealing
cotton all the way from Cairo to Vicksburg,
and what assurance have you that some
enemy of ours will not guide a gang of blue-coats
from Baton Rouge to the place where it
is hidden?"</p>

<p>"I have no assurance whatever, and that is
one thing that robs me of sleep at night," replied
Mr. Randolph; and the nervous way in
which he puffed at his pipe and strode about
the room showed that the thought made him
uneasy every time it came into his mind. "Of
course I stand a chance of losing it; but if I
can keep it a few months longer I know it will
be worth a big sum of money to us&mdash;and good
money, too. One of our neighbors, who shall
be nameless, showed me a couple of Northern
papers he brought from Baton Rouge last
night, and both of them contained a notice of
that sale of cotton in New York. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
seventy bales of it, and it was confiscated at
Port Royal. Some of the ranking officers in
the city also told him that there was some
talk of opening a trade in cotton at all points
occupied by Federal troops, and that influential
parties were applying by the hundred for
permits. He could have told me more if he
had felt like it, but Tom, your miserable
Home Guards, whom I wish I had never heard
of, made him shut his mouth. I am afraid I
ruined myself utterly by helping you organize
that company."</p>

<p>Too nervous and excited to say more, Mr.
Randolph stepped through the window to the
porch, and Tom left the table and went slowly
upstairs. He could not have told what
prompted him to do it, but when he reached
his room he took off his fine uniform and
arrayed himself in a suit of citizen's clothes.
He stood his elegant sword up in the corner of
his closet, and when it slipped down so that
he could not close the door, he kicked it out
of the way as he would have done with any
other worthless piece of furniture. For some
reason he seemed to have conceived a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and violent dislike to everything that reminded
him of the service in which, one
short year ago, his whole soul been wrapped
up; and when he mounted his horse, which
a darkey had brought to the door, and the
animal began to prance and go sideways, as
he had been taught to do, Captain Tom was so
angry that he lashed him unmercifully with
his whip, and would have kept him in a dead
run all the way to the enrolling office, had it
not been for an unexpected and somewhat
startling interruption.</p>

<p>Although there were many extensive and
well-cultivated plantations around Mooreville,
there were some unbroken patches of timber
which stretched away into the Pearl River
country and beyond. This timberland was
mostly low and intersected by innumerable
little streams, which, when the Pearl was
"booming" at certain seasons of the year,
overflowed their banks and turned all the productive
bottom into an immense swamp. It
was here that Tom Randolph's hog-stealing
lieutenant plied his vocation, though he might
have had venison instead of pork, if he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
been too lazy to hunt for it; for the bottom
was a famous place for game of all kinds.
There were runaway negroes there too, by the
score, and their numbers had increased wonderfully
since the war broke out.</p>

<p>It was while Tom was galloping furiously
past one of these patches of timber, which was
separated from the road by a narrow field of
corn, that his attention was attracted by the
loud baying of a pack of hounds; but his
mind was so fully occupied with the punishment
he was inflicting upon his unoffending
horse that he did not give much heed to it,
until he caught sight of a couple of men riding
swiftly through the corn a little in advance of
him. When they reached the fence that ran
between the field and the road one of them
threw off the top rails so that they could jump
their horses over it, while the other raised his
hand as a signal for Tom to stop. Then he
saw that the men were strangers to him, that
they wore gray uniforms, were armed with
carbines and sabres instead of squirrel rifles
and shot guns, and wore plumes in their slouch
hats instead of rooster feathers. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
veterans beyond a doubt; but where did they
come from, and what were they doing in that
country, which was supposed to be guarded by
an efficient company of Home Guards? Their
presence angered Captain Tom, and he wished
he had the authority to order them back where
they belonged without asking any questions;
but they greeted him very civilly.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon," said the foremost, as he
leaped his horse over the ditch and came into
the road where Tom was waiting for him;
then he made a military salute which was
promptly and gracefully returned. "Ah! I
thought you were one of us from the start,"
continued the veteran. "What regiment?"</p>

<p>"I do not belong to any regiment," admitted
Tom. "I am commander of a partisan
company and hold a commission from the
Governor."</p>

<p>"Seen any service?" was the soldier's next
question.</p>

<p>"More than I want to see again," replied
Tom, who had not yet been cured of his propensity
to boast as often as the chance was
presented. "The enemy's gunboats have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
kept me pretty busy since they came up from
New Orleans."</p>

<p>"Well, if you've got courage enough to
fight gunboats, you've got more than I have,"
said the veteran honestly. "How high up
are you?"</p>

<p>"I am a captain."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sah, I have been a
little too fast. I am only a second lieutenant,
and my comrade is a first duty sergeant," and
then the lieutenant and his sergeant both
raised their caps. They had evidently served
under some officer who exacted all the honors
due him.</p>

<p>Of course they took the right course to
gain Tom's good will and bring them an invitation
to supper, but they did not do it intentionally.
Having served at the front ever
since they enlisted, and until they were transferred
to the invalid corps on account of
wounds received in battle they had never seen
any Home Guards, and did not know the estimation
in which that useless organization was
held by the people who knew the most about
them. They had heard of the exploits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
John S. Mosby, who commanded a body of
men that were farmers during the daytime
and robbers and cut-throats at night, and who
had kept certain portions of Virginia in a turmoil
even before he was thought to be worthy
of a commission in the Confederate army, and
they supposed that every company of partisans
was just like his. Consequently they
were ready to treat Tom Randolph with the
greatest respect.</p>

<p>The latter drew himself up very stiffly, assumed
a soldier's position in the saddle, copying
Rodney Gray as nearly as he could, and
said with the dignity befitting his rank:</p>

<p>"I assure you that no apologies are necessary.
I am always glad to shake a loyal Confederate
by the hand." And he proved it by
extending to each of the veterans a palm that
was as limp as a piece of wet rope. "Now,
may I ask where you belong, and what business
brought you to this part of the country?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sah. We used to belong to
Jackson's brigade and division, but were invalided
on account of injuries received in action,
and are now serving as guards at a conscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
camp, dog-gone the luck. We are on
the trail of four escaped Yankees who are
making tracks for Baton Rouge. Didn't you
hear our dogs giving tongue just now?"</p>

<p>"I noticed it, but supposed the hounds
were running something on their own hook.
I noticed, too, that they yelped as though
they were baffled."</p>

<p>"And so they are. We have followed the
trail for forty miles through swamp and briers
and cane, and now we have lost it completely.
We ought to have captured and hung the
villains long ago, but everywhere along their
line of flight they have been assisted by the
negroes. We found abundant proof of it."</p>

<p>"Well, that bangs me!" exclaimed Tom,
who, like many others of his class, labored
under the delusion that the slaves did not
know who their friends were. "Why did you
not shoot the negroes?"</p>

<p>"For the very good reason, sah, that we
could not place the blame upon any particular
ones. We found where the Yanks had been
fed, and once came so close upon them that
we captured some quilts which the darkeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
had loaned them for beds; but among the
hundred and fifty negroes on that plantation
we could not find the one who owned the
quilts. Do you know of any Union men or
blacks around here who would be likely to
give them food and shelter, or aid them in
reaching Baton Rouge?"</p>

<p>If that question had been asked him the
day before Captain Randolph could have mentioned
the names of a dozen white men who
were mean and disloyal enough to give food
and shelter to anybody who wore a blue uniform,
but now he could not think of a single
one. Among others he would have given the
names of some returned soldiers who had
spread dissatisfaction in the ranks of his company
by deriding Tom's ability as a commander
and laughing at the story of his
battles with the iron-clads, and he would have
asked the lieutenant what he thought of
fellows like Rodney Gray and Dick Graham
who did not hesitate to declare that they
were sick of the army, and did not intend
to go back if they could help it. He would
have told, too, of the trading that was continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
going on between the Yankee invaders
and so-called Confederates who lived in Baton
Rouge and Mooreville; but somehow he did
not speak of any of these things. The knowledge
that Mooreville might at any moment be
occupied by Federal cavalry frightened him;
and the plain words his father spoke at the
dinner table opened his eyes to the fact that
silence was sometimes good policy. So he
made answer:</p>

<p>"There are several people about here who
are suspected of being Union, but I can't say
whether they are or not. I drove some out
of the settlement months ago, and they have
never returned."</p>

<p>"That was perfectly right, sah," said the
lieutenant, "but I should think you would be
afraid to stay here. What will you do when
the Yanks come swarming into town, and some
mean sneak tells them that you have been persecuting
Union men? You will have to take
to the brush."</p>

<p>"But do you think the enemy is in sufficient
force to ride over us like that?" inquired Tom
anxiously. He had often asked himself this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
very question, and tried to find comfort in the
hope that the Yankees would never find their
way to Mooreville.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't require much force to take
full possession of a little town like this," replied
the veteran. "I could do it with a
dozen men. We have seen 200 of their
cavalry since we have been on this hunt."</p>

<p>"You have seen them!" ejaculated Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes. We ran into some of them and had
to skirmish our way out. We have seen a
squad on every road except this, and how
those four escaped prisoners we are after
missed seeing them beats me."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that there are
200 Yankees between here and Camp Pinckney?"
exclaimed Tom, who did not like to
hear Rodney's story and Dick's confirmed
in this positive way. "I should think you
would have turned back when you found your
way blocked."</p>

<p>"Since you are an old soldier, sah, and have
snuffed Yankee powder, I know that you are
joking. Our way wasn't blocked, and we had
no orders to turn back. We were commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
to capture those four men and bring them to
Camp Pinckney without the loss of an hour;
and so we kept right on as though there
hadn't been a Yank within 1000 miles of us."</p>

<p>Captain Randolph gazed admiringly at the
veteran, who did not talk or act as though he
had done more than any other soldier would
have done under the circumstances.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">UNCLE SAM'S LOST BOYS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">"I wish</span> I had some of your courage," said
Tom at length. "I may need it, for I am
liable any day to be ordered to Camp Pinckney
with a squad of conscripts."</p>

<p>"W-h-e-w!" whistled the lieutenant. He
looked at the sergeant, the sergeant looked
at him, and then they both looked at Captain
Tom with an expression on their faces that
the latter could not understand. "Well, if
this is the sort of work you partisans have
to do, I am glad I am not a partisan," continued
the lieutenant. "I'd rather go through
Bull Run and take my chances, than attempt
to travel the sixty miles between here and
camp with a squad of conscripts. You will
have to take to the woods, of course, and that
will be the time your conscripts will give you
the slip. If you start with a hundred and get
through with ten you will be doing well."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"There are people here who think I'll not
get through at all," said Tom. "They say
that I and my men will be captured or
killed."</p>

<p>"<i>Of</i> course," answered the lieutenant, who
had never once thought of that contingency.
"It's to be expected that you will take your
chances on that. It is what we all have to do
when we meet the enemy."</p>

<p>"Have you found them a tolerably brave
lot?" inquired Captain Tom, who wanted
much to meet some veteran who would assure
him that the Yankees were all cowards and
did not know how to fight.</p>

<p>"As brave as they make 'em," said the
lieutenant earnestly, "and dead shots into the
bargain. We have bitten off a good deal more
than we can chew in ten years; now you remember
what I tell you. Of course, captain,
I wouldn't say that in the presence of a
civilian; but one old soldier knows how to
take another. Now, don't you think, sah,
that you partisans could lend us a hand in
capturing these Yankees."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; and I will warn my company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
out at once," replied Tom readily.
"Where will I find you at the end of a couple
of hours? I want you and the sergeant to
take supper and lodgings at my mother's
house to-night."</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you, sah, but we couldn't
think of it," said the lieutenant. "Colonel
Parker&mdash;he's the regular who commands the
camp&mdash;would take us to task for wasting
time if he should hear of it, and besides,
we don't want to run the risk of being
gobbled."</p>

<p>"Gobbled?" repeated Captain Tom; for
that was a word that had not yet reached his
part of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>"Captured, you know."</p>

<p>"Who's going to capture you at our
house?" exclaimed Tom, who could feel himself
turning white.</p>

<p>"The Yankee scouts might, if they should
happen to ride into town and any enemy of
yours could tell them where to find us; and
these escaped prisoners might do it."</p>

<p>Captain Randolph was utterly confounded.
His idea of an escaped prisoner was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
running frantically for his life and too badly
frightened to look behind him; but the lieutenant's
words made it plain to him that the
four who were foot-loose somewhere in the
vicinity of Mooreville were not that sort. He
became really alarmed when the soldier went
on to explain the situation.</p>

<p>"You see they were run down and gobbled
up three days ago by a large squad of our cavalry,
who started them for camp under guard
of four good men, one for each prisoner," said
he. "But before they had been away from
us half an hour, what do those Yankees do
but rise up and kill their guards, take their
weapons and ammunition, hitch their horses
in the woods so that they could not go on
and alarm the camp, and dig out through the
swamp for the Mississippi River."</p>

<p>"And those armed and desperate prisoners
are supposed to be somewhere in the settlement
at this moment?" said Tom with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"That is what we think, for the dogs tracked
them within a mile of this cornfield."</p>

<p>"I hope you will hang them the minute you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
get your hands on them," said Tom, in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>"There are fourteen men in my squad and
that is what they allow to do," replied the
lieutenant; "but then they won't, for that
would bring them into trouble with Colonel
Parker. If a captured man sees a chance to
escape he is at liberty to improve it, and to
hurt anything or anybody that gets in his
way; and in doing it he runs the risk of getting
hurt himself."</p>

<p>"The first we heard of it," said the sergeant,
speaking for the first time, "was when
six of our men came into camp on foot, and
reported that they had been disarmed and dismounted
by four Yankees who had paroled
and turned them loose."</p>

<p>"That was about as impudent a thing as I
ever heard of, and it shows what a daring lot
those escaped Yanks are," said the lieutenant;
and instead of getting angry when he thought
of it, he surprised Tom by laughing heartily,
as though he looked upon it as the best kind
of a joke. "A private has no right to parole
anybody, but all the same those Yanks wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
out the papers in due form, and told our boys
that they could either sign them or stay there
in the swamp till a party came out from camp
to bury them. And our boys thought they
had better sign."</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose that escaped prisoners
ever acted that way," said Captain Tom, after
a few minutes of surprised silence.</p>

<p>"Won't they have something to talk about
when they get among their friends?" said
the lieutenant, with another laugh. "They
are brave soldiers, and I'll bet you they are
good fellows; and when the war is over, I
don't care which side whips, I would like to
meet them and talk over the events of the
last few days. We'd have a good laugh over
them."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is any laughing matter to
kill four men as those Yanks killed their
guards," replied Tom, who could not understand
how men fighting under opposing flags
could have the least particle of respect or
kindly feeling for one another.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's war, you know," said the lieutenant
lightly. "But you will see now why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
the sergeant and I must decline your kind
invitation to take supper and sleep at your
house. We don't want to put ourselves in a
position to be surrounded and captured, for
we are pretty close to Baton Rouge, and
those Yanks might decide to take us along instead
of parolling us. If we camp in the
woods with our dogs around us we'll know
that we are safe. Now, we shall have to bid
you good-by, captain. You will get your
company together and do what you can to
help us?"</p>

<p>"Look out that they don't get the first shot
at you, sah," suggested the sergeant.</p>

<p>"And if you are lucky enough to catch
them may I depend on you to send them to
camp under guard?" added the lieutenant.
"It might be to your interest to make the
acquaintance of our colonel."</p>

<p>Captain Randolph shook hands with the
two veterans and promised to do all a loyal
soldier could do to head the fugitives off from
Baton Rouge and send them back to Camp
Pinckney; but there was not so much heart in
his promise as there was in the one he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
before he learned that the Yankees were
armed and daring. In order to keep up appearances,
however, he put his horse into a
lope as soon as the hand-shaking was over,
and made the best of his way to the enrolling
office. He found a few Home Guards loafing
there, but not half as many as he would have
found two days before. These valiant men
had heard that they might be ordered off with
a squad of conscripts any time, and they did
not care to go while the Union cavalry were
riding about through the country. So the
most of them stayed at home, holding themselves
in readiness to take to their heels if
they saw a horseman approaching, and had
any reason to believe that he had been sent
by Captain Roach to warn them to report for
duty. The captain was at his desk, and for
some reason or other seemed to be in the best
of spirits.</p>

<p>"You ought to have dropped in about half
an hour ago," said he, as Tom walked into
the office after hitching his horse at the
rack in front of the door. "I have had
a very pleasant visit from one of your old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
friends, who has just returned from Bragg's
army."</p>

<p>Captain Randolph was so surprised that he
forgot all about the daring Yankees who were
running wild in the woods in close proximity
to Mooreville. He left home for the express
purpose of warning the enrolling officer against
Rodney Gray and his chum Dick Graham,
but something in the captain's manner told
him that his efforts in that direction would
not meet with much success; for the returned
soldiers had had the first chance at the captain,
and they were both smooth-tongued, winning
fellows.</p>

<p>"If you are speaking of Rodney Gray&mdash;&mdash;"
began Tom, in angry tones.</p>

<p>"So you have seen him, have you!" exclaimed
the enrolling officer, leaning back in
his chair and breaking out into a peal of
laughter. "Well, he's a good one, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"If you are speaking of him," sputtered
Tom, "you know as well as I do that he is no
friend of mine. I have told you so more times
than I can remember."</p>

<p>"I know you have, and I confess that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
treated him and his chum rather coldly when
they came into the office and said they wanted
to set themselves square with me by showing
that they were honorably discharged Confederate
soldiers," answered the captain. "But
they did not seem to care a snap for me or for
my opinion of them."</p>

<p>"That's just like Rodney's impudence,"
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, you see he has a sort of good-natured
contempt for me because I am not a
veteran. He knows more in five minutes than
I do in a month, and he is not ignorant of the
fact. He and his chum sat down without
waiting to be asked, talked as though they
had known me always, and I laughed till I
cried over the stories they told of army life.
I hope to hear more of those stories when I go
up to Gray's to dinner on Thursday."</p>

<p>If the enrolling officer had aimed a blow at
him with the ebony ruler that lay on his desk
Tom Randolph would not have been more
dumfounded. He leaned heavily upon the
back of a chair for a moment or two, and then
dropped almost helplessly into it.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>"To Gray's&mdash;to dinner on Thursday!" he
repeated faintly. "You can't&mdash;you mustn't
go there."</p>

<p>"What's the reason I mustn't?" demanded
Captain Roach, surprised in his turn. "Good
dinners are not so plenty these times that I
can afford to throw them over my shoulder."</p>

<p>"It isn't that," replied Tom. "It's the
sentiments of the people who invited you that
I object to. When you go into old man
Gray's house you will go plump into a nest
of traitors."</p>

<p>"No, I reckon not. A man who volunteers
and does a soldier's duty for fifteen long
months, and who shows me an honorable discharge,
can't well be called a traitor."</p>

<p>"He stayed in the army after he got there
because he had to, and did a soldier's duty for
the very good reason that he couldn't help
himself," said Captain Tom spitefully. "But
see how he talks since he came back! He
says he will not go into the army again,
and declares that the Yanks who captured
him while he was on the way home were
gentlemen."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what would you think if you had
been in his place? What was there to hinder
those Yanks from taking him and Graham to
Baton Rouge and turning them over to the
provost marshal? They were in uniform when
they were captured."</p>

<p>"I see you are on the side of those traitors,"
said Tom, rising to his feet and pounding
lightly upon the captain's desk with his
clenched hand, "and I have this much to say
to you: If you go to Gray's you will no longer
be welcome at our house."</p>

<p>"I shall be sorry for that, of course, but I
don't suppose I can help it. Gray and his
chum know all about soldiering, and as I may
have to go into the army myself some day, I
want to learn all I can from them. I think
you would be wise to do the same."</p>

<p>"And while you have been having a good
time with my enemies, I have been working
for the cause which you made oath to support
but seem to have deserted," continued Tom
impressively. "I have been making arrangements
to capture some of the very men whom
Rodney Gray and Dick Graham promised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
assist if they found them in trouble. I want
all you fellows," here he turned about and
addressed himself to the Home Guards who
had come into the office to hear what passed
between their captain and the enrolling officer,
"to mount your horses at once and go in pursuit
of four escaped prisoners who are hiding
in the woods somewhere on the outskirts of
the town. As you go, warn every other member
of the company you see to turn out and
join in the chase."</p>

<p>"Why, captain, what do you mean?" cried
the enrolling officer, becoming excited at once.</p>

<p>Without paying the least attention to him
or his question, Captain Tom proceeded to give
his men a short and very incomplete account
of the interview he had held with the two
veterans while he was on his way to town.
We say the account was incomplete because
Tom did not tell his men that the fugitives
had armed themselves when they escaped
from their guards, and had been carrying
things with a high hand ever since. He was
afraid he could not raise much of a squad to
aid in the pursuit if he told that; so all he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
said was that the four Yankees were striking
for Baton Rouge, that fourteen Confederate
veterans had been following them with hounds
for three days past, and that if they (the
Home Guards) would turn out in a body and
capture the prisoners from under the noses of
the Confederates, it might be a feather in their
hats. The Home Guards thought so too; and
hardly waiting for Tom to get through with
what he had to tell them, they made a rush
through the door toward the rack at which
their horses were hitched.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you so prompt to obey
orders," shouted Captain Tom, following them
to the sidewalk and waving his hand to them
as they rode off one after the other. "We'll
show the authorities that there are some loyal
people around here yet. I'll be with you as
soon as I can ride home and get my uniform
and weapons, but you needn't wait. Divide
yourselves into squads of six or eight, and
search every nook and corner of the woods you
can get into between this time and dark. And
don't forget corn-cribs and nigger cabins, nor
the cellars and lofts of Union men."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it strange that you did not bring
those Confederate officers straight to my
office," said the conscript captain, when the
last Home Guard had ridden away out of
sight.</p>

<p>"Since you have deserted loyal people for
the society of those who say that they will not
do anything more for the cause they pretend
to believe in, I am sorry myself that I did not
bring them here," answered Tom. "But I
did not once think of it. I am glad they did
not accept my invitation to supper, for I
should have felt obliged to ask you to join
them. Where are you going?" he added,
when Captain Roach began bundling his
papers into his desk and locking the drawers.</p>

<p>"I am going to help capture those four
Yankees," said he. "They are Confederate
prisoners, and I am a Confederate officer."</p>

<p>Tom did not wait to see him off, but mounted
his horse and set out for home at top speed,
as if he were impatient to arm himself and
join his men in the pursuit; but he went long
distances out of his way to summon members
of his company whom he knew he would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
find at home, so that it was after three o'clock
when he galloped through his father's gate
and drew rein at the foot of the steps. He
had had ample time to think over the situation
and make up his mind what he would
do.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," exclaimed Mrs. Randolph,
when Tom had hurriedly explained matters to
her, "you must not risk your life and liberty
by going in pursuit of those escaped prisoners.
I'll never consent to it; never in this world."</p>

<p>"Then show me, please, how I can get out of
it," answered Captain Tom, gently disengaging
himself from his mother's clinging hands
and starting up the stairs toward his room.
"Some of my men are in the woods by this
time, and if that lieutenant should happen to
run against them, his first question would
be: 'Where's your captain? He ought to
be here, conducting the pursuit in person.'
Really I must show up, mother, for I want
those veterans to tell Colonel Parker, when
they go back to camp, that I did all I could
to aid them in capturing the Yanks."</p>

<p>"Then you are sure they will be captured&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
they will not be permitted to roam at
liberty during the night?" said Mrs. Randolph,
who had never before exhibited so
much nervousness and anxiety as she did at
that moment. "I couldn't sleep if I knew
they were at large."</p>

<p>"No, I am not sure of it, for they have
proved themselves to be both daring and
cunning. Just think what they have done!
They have killed their guards, captured and
paroled half a dozen soldiers, and kept out of
reach of the hounds for three days; and such
men are not going to be taken easily, I bet
you," replied Tom from the head of the
stairs; and then he went into his room to don
his uniform and buckle on his sword and
revolver. A few minutes later he came out to
ask his mother what she thought of Captain
Roach's way of doing business.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he couldn't be reported and
hauled over the coals for associating with those
Grays?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"If the captain is disloyal&mdash;and we have no
way of judging of his feelings except by his
actions&mdash;I certainly think his superior officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
ought to know it," said Mrs. Randolph.
"But, my dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you want to say," interrupted
Captain Tom. "You mean that if I report
him for any of his shortcomings, he will
conscript me. Then he had better do it at
once, for if he waits a week it will be too
late."</p>

<p>"Tom, are you going to resign your commission?"</p>

<p>"I am going to take Larkin's place as overseer
of this plantation," replied Tom, very
decidedly. "I thought it would be a big
come-down at first, but since I have thought
the matter over, I have made up my mind that
it will be a change for the better. I can't be
forced into the army; being a civilian I may
be able to obtain some salt, coffee, and things
from the Yanks; and if father ever has a
chance to sell that cotton, I shall be at hand to
help him run it up out of the swamp."</p>

<p>Captain Tom fully expected that his mother
would strongly object to these plans, and he
even thought she might denounce him as a
traitor to the South and its flag; but somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
to his surprise she did nothing of the
kind. She, too, had had leisure to think the
matter over, and much against her will had
been obliged to confess to herself that it didn't
pay to be too good a rebel while the Federals
held undisputed possession of Baton Rouge,
and blue-coated cavalry were scouting about
through the country. She even wished that
Tom would hide his uniform, his military
saddle and bridle, and his sword where nobody
would ever see them again.</p>

<p>"That is what I have decided to do," continued
Captain Tom, as he slipped his six-shooter
into its holster and came down the
stairs, "and I mean to attend to it as soon as
I see those four Yanks captured."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be as well," answered
his mother. "Delays are sometimes dangerous.
But I don't see how I can give my
consent to let you go on this expedition."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me. I am bound to
come back all right, and I'll never have to go
on another. And when that traitor Roach
gets ready to send off his conscripts, he can
tell somebody besides me to take them."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you recommend anyone to the Governor
to take your place?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I don't care whether or not
anybody gets it, so long as Lambert is left out
in the cold with a fair chance of being sent to
Camp Pinckney. Good-by, mother. I must be
off, or some evil-minded person in the settlement
will accuse me of shirking my duty."</p>

<p>The leave-taking was a tearful one on Mrs.
Randolph's part, but Captain Tom could not
have been more unconcerned if he had been
going to Mooreville to buy groceries. He
thought he knew a way to keep up his reputation
as a loyal Southerner and steer clear of
the dreaded Yankees at the same time.</p>

<p>"There's one thing about it," soliloquized
Tom, as he galloped out of the gate, waving a
last farewell to his mother as he went, "our
folks are not as fierce for secession as they
used to be, and I am mighty glad to know it.
We're getting so we live awful hard. Our
table is a sight to behold, with nothing on it
but corn pone, bacon, sweet potato coffee, and
buttermilk from one week's end to another's,
and I am getting tired of such grub. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
where am I going to raise forty-five dollars in
Confederate money to pay for a pair of boots
when these wear out? There's plenty of gold
in the house, and I could use it to good advantage
if I could only get into Baton Rouge and
obtain a permit from the provost marshal to
trade there. I'll bet you that Rodney Gray
and that chum of his will be rigged out spick-and-span
from head to foot the next time I see
them, and they will buy their things inside
the Yankee lines, too. Now, I'll tell you
what's a fact; I've just as much right to use
the Yankees as they have."</p>

<p>When Captain Tom reached this point in his
meditations he drew rein in front of a pair
of bars giving entrance into a lane that ran
through his father's plantation in the direction
of the river. The house was concealed
from his view by an abrupt bend in the road,
and a hasty glance on each side showed him
that there was no one in sight; so he bent
down from his saddle, opened the bars, and
rode into the lane. It is true that the escaped
prisoners and the soldiers and hounds that
were pursuing them were not on that side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
the road, but two miles away in the opposite
direction, but Captain Tom did not stop to
think of that. He knew where he was going,
and made all haste to get there as soon as he
had put up the bars.</p>

<p>"There are not half a dozen citizens in the
neighborhood who will lend a hand in catching
those prisoners, and the last one of the
Home Guards will fall out and strike for a
place of safety the minute they find out that
the Yanks are armed," thought Tom, as he
rode swiftly along the lane, turning about in
his saddle now and then to make sure that no
one was observing his movements. "And
that being the case, why should I risk my
life in trying to capture them? Say! By
gracious!"</p>

<p>As this exclamation fell from Captain Tom's
lips he pulled up his horse with a jerk, and
looked first at the road and then at the cluster
of trees that shut the house off from his sight.
He spent a minute or two in this way and then
rode on again.</p>

<p>"That's a splendid idea, but my wit always
comes too late to be of any use to me," said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
angrily; and he avenged himself on his slow
wit by hitting his spirited horse such a stinging
cut with his whip that the animal came
very near "flying" the road and going off into
the ditch. "Instead of this gray uniform,
which will send me to a Northern prison if the
Yankees ever catch me with it on, why didn't
I keep on my citizen's clothes? Then I
needn't have had the least fear of meeting the
prisoners. I could have fed and sheltered
them to-night and guided them to the city in
the morning; and in return for my services I
could have asked the provost marshal to give
me a permit to buy some things in the stores.
Dog-gone the luck!"</p>

<p>Captain Randolph hit his horse another
merciless blow with the whip, and this time
the animal's sudden spring had a most astounding
result. He jumped sideways clear
over the ditch that ran by the side of the road,
and when he landed on the opposite bank
he stopped so quickly that his rider was
thrown headlong from his saddle, bringing up
among the cotton stalks ten feet farther on.
He was not in the least injured or even jarred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
by his fall, but he was tolerably angry to find
himself so easily unhorsed. He raised himself
on his elbow, but before he could make another
move, or give utterance to his pent-up
feelings, a voice near at hand said pleasantly:</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, John, but didn't expect
to be introduced in such a promiscuous manner,
you know. Don't stand on ceremony,
but come right in. The latch-string is always
out."</p>

<p>This incident happened almost in the edge
of the little grove of evergreens toward which
Captain Tom had been directing his course
ever since he passed through the bars. It was
his intention to conceal himself and his horse
among the evergreens and remain there in
safety until dark, while the rest of the Home
Guards and the citizens, if any there were
who had a fancy to join Captain Roach in
such perilous business, searched the woods
for the escaped prisoners.</p>

<p>Tom Randolph's first feeling was one of
the most intense surprise, without a particle
of fear or anxiety in it; but when he rolled
over on his side to bring his face toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
grove, he was almost paralyzed with terror to
see three ragged fellows in nondescript uniforms
advancing swiftly upon him, while a
fourth covered his head with a cocked carbine
from the edge of the evergreens. One of the
three secured his horse, which had not moved
an inch since he rid himself of his inhuman
rider, a second swung the black muzzle of a
musket in unpleasant proximity to his face,
and the third knelt by his side and took possession
of his sword and revolver.</p>

<p>"Was yer looking fur we uns, Johnny
boy?" chuckled the one who held the musket.
"If yer was, hyar we is. Mighty glad
to see yer, and dat's a fac'. Come along now,
and we uns will cut a watermillyun."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who are you?" gasped Tom, whose
terror was greatly increased by the soldier's
grim humor.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small smcap">Tom Randolph captured by the escaped prisoners.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>"Well, Johnny, we're so ragged and dirty
just now that we don't rightly know who we
are, except that we are some of Uncle Sam's
lost boys," replied the one who had captured
the sword and revolver. "I expect he's down
to Baton Rouge now waiting for us, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
we'd best be toddling along. Take that horse
into the grove out of sight, Ben. Come on,
Johnny."</p>

<p>"Have you heard hounds giving tongue in
the woods anywhere about here?" inquired
the one who had first spoken.</p>

<p>Tom was so nearly overcome with fear that
he could not answer. He hardly knew when
two of Uncle Sam's lost boys took him by the
arms and raised him to his feet. All he realized
was that he had run squarely into the
hands of those he had tried so hard to avoid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">NED GRIFFIN BRINGS NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">After</span> accompanying our Confederate
hero, Rodney Gray, through fifteen
months of army life, during which he saw
more adventures, endured more hardships and
learned more wisdom than he had ever dreamed
of, we left him, at the close of the second volume
of this series, safe in the home of his boyhood,
which he had left for the avowed purpose
of "driving the Yankees out of Missouri."
He confidently assured his mother and the
servants who assembled to see him off that
it would not take more than three or four
months to do that, and then he would return,
like Lentulus of old, "with victorious eagles."
Instead of that, he came back as ragged and
disgusted a specimen of a Confederate volunteer
as could be found anywhere in the South
at the time of which we write, and that is saying
a good deal. The summer clothing given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
him and his comrades at Tupelo after the retreat
from Corinth, and which had been furnished
by one of the numerous "ladies' associations"
of the South, was not calculated to
stand soldier treatment. The trousers Rodney
wore were made of a rich shawl, and his blouse
had once been part of a costly silk dress. His
nights at the camp-fire, and the days he had
passed trudging along dusty roads, had played
sad havoc with his "pictured uniform." That
was what Dick Graham called it, and his regiment,
which had been pretty well supplied with
clothing of the same description, presented a
very fantastic appearance the first time they
went on dress parade.</p>

<p>You will remember that Rodney brought
Dick home with him. Dick wanted to get
into Missouri where his parents were, and in
order to do that it was necessary that he
should find some point on the Mississippi that
was not guarded by Federal gunboats. They
came from Camp Pinckney on foot, and had
been doing duty as infantrymen for months,
although their regiment was always spoken
of as the &mdash;th Missouri cavalry. Their horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
had been "confiscated" by the commissary
department during that dreary "mud march"
from the disastrous battlefield of Pea Ridge
to Van Buren and Pocahontas. The commanding
general, Van Dorn, did not need cavalry
during that march, but it was necessary
that his wagon train should go through; so as
fast as his jaded teams gave out and dropped
in the road, he took cavalry horses to replace
them, and in process of time the two Barrington
boys found themselves on foot like hundreds
of others.</p>

<p>You will remember, too, that when Rodney
reached home he led his friend into the parlor
and pushed him into an easy-chair with the
words: "Stay here till I find somebody," and
that his mother came in a moment later.
The way in which the two greeted each other
after their long separation was something of
which Dick Graham could not remain an unmoved
spectator, for it made him think of his
own mother away off across the river, whom
he might never see again. He staggered
rather than walked to the window, and looked
out at the oleanders in the yard.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"O Rodney, is it possible that you have
come back to me at last!" exclaimed Mrs.
Gray tearfully; and Dick knew, without turning
his head, that she was holding her stalwart
son off at arms' length and giving him a good
looking over.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the returned soldier,
placing his arm about his mother's waist and
leading her toward a sofa, "I have come back,
and I have come to stay. The last words you
said to me right out there on the gallery were
that you never wanted to hear that I had
failed to do my duty. You haven't heard
any such report as that, have you? I have
done the best I could, but I have come back
whipped; and I wish every other man who
wears a gray jacket were honest enough to
say the same thing."</p>

<p>The listening Dick expected to hear his
chum soundly rebuked for giving utterance to
such sentiments, because he knew that the
women were much more zealous for the cause
of Southern independence than their male
relatives, that they were exerting themselves to
the utmost to keep the war spirit at fever heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and that, if it hadn't been for them, the army
from which he had just been discharged would
have dwindled to a corporal's guard long ago.
By an accidental glance into a mirror that
hung on a side wall Dick saw that Mrs. Gray
was holding her soldier boy tightly clasped
in her arms; but he did not hear her utter
one word of reproach. Like many another
mother's, her patriotism had been sorely tried,
and now that Rodney had returned safe and
sound she considered that she had done all
for the cause that could be expected of her,
and hoped that he would never leave her side
again. Let some other mother's son&mdash;Mrs.
Randolph's, for instance&mdash;take Rodney's place
at the front.</p>

<p>"Say!" exclaimed Rodney, starting up
all of a sudden. "What's the matter here?
This room doesn't look just as it did the last
time I saw it. Where's the carpet?"</p>

<p>"It was cut into blankets and sent to Corinth,
along with a lot of other things that I thought
might be of use to you ragged, shivering soldiers,"
replied his mother.</p>

<p>"I hoped you would never be called upon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
make the smallest sacrifice," said Rodney in a
tone of disgust.</p>

<p>"Do you think I made no sacrifice when
I sent you to the field?" said Mrs. Gray reproachfully.
"O Rodney."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," said the boy quickly.
"But you don't want to rob yourself for the
sake of those fellows up there," bobbing his
head in the direction in which he supposed
Bragg's army to be. "Like as not the poor,
foolish woman who cut her shawl up to
make these trousers of mine will suffer with
cold for the want of it. But I am forgetting
something. Come here, old fellow. Mother,
you have often heard me speak of Dick
Graham, the only brother I've got. Well, here
he is. Rags and dust and all, that's Dick.
Kiss him for his mother, and tell me where I
will find father."</p>

<p>The lonely, homesick young Missourian was
almost overwhelmed by the kindly greeting
that Rodney's mother gave him, but his friend
was quick to notice it and came to his relief.
When his mother said that Mr. Gray had
gone to Mooreville on business and might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
not be back for an hour or two, he seized
Dick by the arm and hurried him up to his
room.</p>

<p>"I have known you a good while, but I never
saw you look so glum before," said he, as he
closed the door and forced Dick into a seat.</p>

<p>"You may well say that," replied the latter.
"I bore up pretty well until I saw you and
your mother together, and that knocked me.
It's a fur ways to Little Rock, and there are a
good many Yanks on the road."</p>

<p>"I'll trust you and your discharge to get
along with the Yankee cavalry if I can only
see you safe over the river," said Rodney.
"There is where the fun is going to come in."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that the commanding
naval officer, or the provost marshal at Baton
Rouge, might be prevailed upon to give me
permission to go over openly and above-board?"
inquired Dick.</p>

<p>"Not much. You wouldn't do it yourself
if you were in their places. How would they
know but that you were a spy or a bearer of
secret despatches, and that your discharge was
a humbug? I tell you, Dick, since I have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
time to think of the way those Yankee scouts
treated us when they told us to come in out of
the wet, I confess to a very friendly feeling for
the Yankees. How many are there who would
have run us in, just to be able to say that they
had captured a couple of graybacks?"</p>

<p>"That's so," assented Dick.</p>

<p>"Now the best thing you can do is to stay
with me long enough to rest your hands and
face, say a week or such a matter, and then
we'll go up to Vicksburg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suffering Moses!" exclaimed Dick.
"There is a portion of two Yankee fleets up
there, according to the last report I read, and
they are fighting our fellows all the time."</p>

<p>"Well, say Port Hudson then. There
hasn't been much of any fighting there. We'll
buy a light, tight boat and provision it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Dick straightened up, and turned his
pockets inside out one after the other to show
that they were empty.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean by that," exclaimed
Rodney, "but I'll see that you have
all the money you want&mdash;money, I said, and
not such stuff as that," he added, thrusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
his hand into his pocket and pulling out the
roll of Confederate scrip that the paymaster
had given him with his discharge. "Mother
was wild for Southern independence when
this thing was first started, but thought it
wise to prepare for a rainy day; so she and
father and I put away a little gold."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for the fact that my father
and mother did the same thing, I'd call you a
traitor," said Dick.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know we are in good company,"
answered Rodney with a laugh. "And we
don't think any the less of ourselves for putting
away that gold, either. Think what a
fix Washington's army was in when it was
mustered out at Newburgh. Those men were
victorious, but even victors must eat and have
something to wear, and what did they have
to live on? Do you suppose they would have
thought seriously of mutiny if they had had
a little store of hard stuff to fall back on?
That's why we hid the gold; and it doesn't
make any difference what sort of laws the
government at Richmond passes, we are going
to keep what we have. Now, let me show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
you how much my old company thought of
me."</p>

<p>Although Rodney's room had been regularly
cared for during the long months it had been
without an occupant, he noticed, the moment
he went into it, that nothing had been disturbed.
A newspaper, which he had tossed
upon the floor the morning he left, was lying
in nearly the same spot yet; and his light
fowling-piece was standing in the corner
where he had placed it after shooting a hawk
that was bothering Aunt Martha's chickens.
He opened the door of his closet as he spoke,
and almost without looking put his hand upon
the elegant cavalry sabre that Bob Hubbard's
Rangers had given him. The uniform he had
worn while acting as drill-master, and his
military saddle and bridle were there, too.</p>

<p>"I left them at home because I knew they
would get me captured if I tried to take them
into Missouri," said he. "Now, pull off that
picture-book," he added, nodding toward
Dick's silk blouse, "and after you have removed
a little of the Louisiana soil from your
features, put on this citizen's suit. I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
sure it will fit you, but it is the best I can do
until I see how trade is."</p>

<p>"I suppose gold is as potent in Baton
Rouge as it was in Little Rock," said Dick.
"But do you think our discharges will take
us inside the Yankee lines?"</p>

<p>"We'll make them," replied Rodney.
"We'll say that we want to report ourselves
to the provost marshal and get a paper of
some kind from him that will keep the Federal
scouts from bothering us; and when we see
him we'll bounce him for permission to trade."</p>

<p>The boys went to work to make such improvements
in their personal appearance as
they could with plenty of soap and water and
Rodney's abundant wardrobe, and when a bell
rang in a lower hall half an hour later, they
answered it looking quite unlike the dusty
ragamuffins who had walked unbidden into
Mrs. Gray's front parlor. It is true that their
coats were a little short in the sleeves and
tight across the shoulders, but there were no
holes in them or in the light shoes they wore
on their feet.</p>

<p>"That's all O. K., mother," said Rodney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
catching a momentary glimpse of a well-filled
table through the open door. "When you can't
think of any other way to put in the time, just
ask us if we want something to eat. Now come
and sit down with us, and tell us everything
that's happened since I have been in the army."</p>

<p>Rodney's entrance into the dining room
seemed to be the signal that the house servants
had been waiting for. The moment he
stepped over the threshold they rushed in
through every door, some smiling, some laughing
outright, and all pushing and crowding
one another in the effort to be the first to
shake "young moster" by the hand. Foremost
in the struggle was Rosebud, the darkey
who had been Rodney's playmate in the days
of his babyhood, and who yelled so dolefully
when he went away. Although they all inquired
particularly after his health, there was
not one among them who asked what he
thought of the Yankees as fighters now that
he had had some experience with them. They
knew as well as he did that he and his comrades
had failed utterly in their efforts to take
Missouri out of the Union.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gray could not describe in one dinner
hour everything that had happened in and
around Mooreville during the last fifteen
months, nor could she do it in a dozen hours;
and even at the end of a week she and her
husband had many questions to answer as well
as many to ask. But before he went to bed
that night Rodney knew pretty nearly what
Tom Randolph and his Home Guards had
been doing, and how he and the enrolling
officer stood in the community, and had been
made to see at least one thing very clearly:
the surest way for him to keep out of the
army was to follow Ned Griffin's example and
take a position as overseer on one of his
father's plantations.</p>

<p>"I am overjoyed to know that you have
decided to remain at home with us," said his
father, "but, to be honest, I did not look for
it, so I gave Griffin the best opening I had.
Our upper plantation, as you are aware, is
right in the middle of the woods; but I think
Ned will be willing to make the change if
I ask him."</p>

<p>"Not for the world," said Rodney quickly.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"I am used to living in the woods, so I will
take the little farm and let Ned and his
mother stay near civilization, where they can
see white folks once in a while. Besides, I'd
rather like to be within reach of the cotton
you've got up there. A Northern paper that
came into our hands just before we left Tupelo
contained the information that there's going
to be trading allowed along the river, and
what the Yanks especially want is cotton."</p>

<p>"I don't blame them," said Mr. Gray, with
a smile. "It is worth sixty cents a pound in
New York."</p>

<p>This piece of news almost took Rodney's
breath away.</p>

<p>"Four hundred and fifty bales at&mdash;let me
see; $270 a&mdash;&mdash;Great Scott, father! That
doesn't look as though you are going to be
reduced to beggary."</p>

<p>"But you must bear in mind that our cotton
is not in New York, but concealed in the
depths of a swamp," said his mother; and
Rodney afterward had occasion to recall the
words when he was working night and day,
with Sailor Jack's assistance and Marcy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
to keep this cotton out of the hands of rascals,
both Union and Confederate, who were trying
their best to take it from him by force or to
cheat him out of it. This news was so very
important that it could be talked of only in
whispers; and after the difficulties that lay in
the way of getting the cotton into the hands of
the traders had been discussed in tones so low
that no eavesdropper at the door could have
heard a word of it, Mrs. Gray said in her
ordinary voice:</p>

<p>"You boys have often spoken of having
Northern papers in your possession. Did your
officers permit that?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," said Rodney, with a laugh.
"It was against orders to look at one of them,
and I have seen men triced up by the thumbs
for disregarding that order."</p>

<p>"Then how did they get inside our lines?"</p>

<p>"They were taken from dead Yanks, or out
of the pockets of prisoners," replied Rodney.
"Sometimes they were handed over to an
officer, or thrown aside to be picked up by
other men who didn't care so much for orders;
and those who got them were mighty careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
to know who was around when they took them
out to read them. Why, mother, I am telling
you the gospel truth when I say that all the
reliable news we army fellows got was what
came to us through the columns of Northern
papers, or from the mouths of Northern prisoners.
But, as I was saying&mdash;$120,000 and
over. That's what your cotton is worth,
father, and I will take the little farm so as to
be where I can see it once in a while."</p>

<p>There were so many questions to be asked
and answered that Rodney and Dick scarcely
stirred out of the house during the whole of
the next day. On the second day they rode
out to call upon Ned Griffin and his mother,
both of whom shed tears of joy and gratitude
when they took Rodney by the hand.</p>

<p>"Yes; thanks to your father's kindness, I
am here yet," said Ned, wiping his eyes, which
grew misty every time he spoke of his benefactor,
"though mercy knows how I am going
to pay the debt I shall owe him when the
terms of the conscription law are complied
with. A hundred pounds of beef and bacon
for every darkey on this place, big and little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
and beef and bacon worth&mdash;worth way up
yonder," said Ned, pointing to the ceiling.
"It will take me a lifetime to pay it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it won't," said Rodney encouragingly,
"for if goods are high, your services
will command wages in proportion; don't you
see?"</p>

<p>"Do you imagine that I will ever charge
your father a cent after what he has done for
me?" cried Ned indignantly. "I am not that
kind of a fellow, and you ought to know it."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose that is sentiment, but it
isn't business," said the practical Rodney.
"Now, then, what do you know? Have you
the straight of the fights the Home Guards
had with those gunboats?"</p>

<p>Ned laughed until he was red in the face,
and then went on to give the "straight" of
one "fight" as he had heard it from indignant
citizens of Baton Rouge, who had petitioned
General Williams, the Union commander, to
send a company of cavalry to Mooreville with
orders to exterminate the Home Guards or
drive them from the country. The boys heard
much the same story from several disabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
veterans of Bragg's army, upon whom they
called on their way home, and that was the
way Rodney came to know so much about
what had been transpiring along the river during
his absence. He and Dick also learned
from various sources that the enrolling officer
would prove to be a jolly and entertaining
companion when once they became acquainted
with him, but as he was Tom Randolph's
friend, they had better not trust him too far
at first.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'll not trust him at all," said
Rodney. "We can tell better after we have
had a look at him. As we are not in the Confederate
service we are under no obligations
to go near him; still he might look upon it
as a courteous and friendly act if we were
to drop into his office to-morrow and tell him
'hallo!'"</p>

<p>With this object in view they rode to Mooreville
on the afternoon of the next day, and
that was the time they saw Tom Randolph and
frightened him nearly out of his wits, as we
have recorded, by assuring him that he need
not expect to take a squad of conscripts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Camp Pinckney without having a brush with
the Union cavalry. It was after they left him
that they heard the hounds giving tongue in
the woods; but such sounds were common
enough in that country, and so they paid no
attention to it, although they might have done
so had they been able to look far enough into
the future to see what was going to happen
afterward.</p>

<p>When they reached the enrolling office Rodney
found that he knew everyone there except
the officer in charge; and as he shook hands
with some and barely nodded to others, he
told himself that they were just the sort of
men he expected to find in Tom Randolph's
company of Home Guards. There were a few
industrious, hard-working ones among them,
but the majority were long-haired, lazy vagabonds,
who had never been known to earn an
honest living.</p>

<p>"They're a pretty set to fight a gunboat,"
he whispered to Dick while the two were
hitching their horses at the rack. "And I'll
bet my roll of Confederate scrip against yours
that they never take any conscripts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
camp of instruction. I'll go farther, and say
that they will never start with any, for when
they are wanted they'll not be found. Now
let's go in and see what sort of a chap we have
to deal with."</p>

<p>Dick Graham put him down at once as a
conceited prig, who did not know a thing outside
of office routine, and was so disgusted
with the airs he tried to throw on that he did
not salute when he handed out his discharge;
but Rodney, who did not care any more for
the enrolling officer than he did for a crooked
stick in the road, pursued a different course,
and very soon succeeded in making Captain
Roach ashamed of himself. He made him see
that there was a big difference between a veteran
soldier and a Home Guard, and ended by
asking him to dinner.</p>

<p>"Now you've done it," said Dick, as the
two mounted their horses and rode homeward.
"If your mother had wanted that officer at
her table, don't you think she would have
asked him long ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Rodney.
"We're privileged characters, and my folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
will back up anything we do or say. Besides,
during the last three days I've got to be a
policy man."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Just this: so long as Captain Roach
collogues with Tom Randolph and his mother&mdash;she's
the one I am afraid of, for she is a
schemer from the word go, I tell you&mdash;so long
will he be more or less under their influence;
and I am well enough acquainted with them
to know that they would not hesitate to say
or do anything that came into their heads if
they thought they could set him against me.
So I wanted the first chance at the captain.
There's no telling at what moment he may be
able to do us a good turn."</p>

<p>When the boys reached home they were surprised
to find that there was a good deal of
suppressed excitement among the servants,
which showed itself now and then in spite of
all their efforts to keep it concealed. Rodney's
black playmate, who came to the steps
to take charge of their horses, was full of
news, but his master could not get anything
out of him, although he threatened, if he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
not speak, to take him on board the gunboats
and sell him to the Yankees the first
thing in the morning. When they went into
the house they met Mrs. Gray, whose face
showed that she was not altogether at her
ease.</p>

<p>"What's up?" demanded Rodney.</p>

<p>"Nothing more than we can expect in
times like these, I suppose," she replied, with
a smile. "But the blacks are frightened, and
of course that has an effect on me. There are
four escaped Union prisoners in the vicinity,
and some Confederate soldiers are pursuing
them with bloodhounds."</p>

<p>Dick Graham took note of the fact that she
did not say "some of <i>our</i> soldiers," as almost
every other Southern woman would have
done. He thought of the Federal scouts
who had captured and released himself and
Rodney a few days before, and said mentally:</p>

<p>"I hope they'll not catch them. I wish
we could find them long enough to hand them
a bottle of turpentine. That would throw the
dogs off their trail in short order."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what are the blacks frightened at?"
continued Rodney. "The Yanks don't make
war on people of their color."</p>

<p>"But they know that there are two ex-Confederate
soldiers in this house&mdash;&mdash;" began
Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"Now I understand it!" exclaimed Rodney.
"And that was the reason Rosebud wouldn't
tell me what he had on his mind, though I
promised to sell him if he didn't. He was
afraid that Dick and I would saddle up and
go after those prisoners. Well, we're not
making war on Yanks so much as we were, so
you can rest easy, mother. But how did you
find it out? We didn't hear a word of it in
town or along the road."</p>

<p>"Three of the pursuing party rode into the
yard not half an hour ago to tell me of it, and
to ask if I thought any of our blacks would be
likely to feed and shelter the Federals if they
came on the plantation," answered Mrs. Gray.
"And I could only say truthfully that I was
sure they would. The soldiers do not mean
to give the poor fellows any rest, or the least
chance to escape to the river."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>"Hal-lo!" ejaculated Rodney. "Is a Yank
a poor fellow in your estimation?"</p>

<p>"A weary and hungry man is always an
object of pity," replied his mother, "and
such have never been turned from this plantation
without having their wants relieved.
And now the soldiers have gone and put those
dreadful Home Guards after them."</p>

<p>"Haw, haw!" laughed Rodney. "Tom
Randolph's Home Guards may be dreadful to
unarmed Union men who have never snuffed
powder, but veterans, such as I take these
escaped prisoners to be, won't stand in fear of
them. Why, mother, if these four men were
armed they would whip Tom's whole company."</p>

<p>"They are thoroughly armed," said Mrs.
Gray. "And when they are in need of food
they walk right into a plantation house and
demand it."</p>

<p>"That's all right too. You don't expect
men to go hungry when there's grub in sight,
just because they have the misfortune to be
Yanks, do you? Where did they get their
weapons?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gray shuddered as she told the story
as we have already heard it; and when she described
how the fugitives had surprised, captured,
and paroled a squad of six men who had
been sent in pursuit of them, Rodney's face
and Dick's beamed with admiration.</p>

<p>"I'll bet they are bricks," said the former.</p>

<p>"Top-notch," chimed in Dick.</p>

<p>"And do the Home Guards know that the
Yanks are armed?" continued Rodney. "If
they do, there isn't a man in the company who
will join in the pursuit. They'll make a big
show of going if Tom orders them out, but the
first good chance they get they'll hide in the
woods."</p>

<p>"And I don't know that I blame them,"
observed Dick.</p>

<p>"Nor me. There's no fun in walking up on
an armed and desperate man when he is concealed
and can see every move you make,
while you cannot see hide nor hair of him.
Mother," here he sunk his voice to a whisper,
"I hope they won't catch those fellows; and
if they come around this house I'll help them
if I can."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>"Here too," whispered Dick; and Mrs. Gray
never uttered a word of rebuke. The boys
believed that she would help them herself.</p>

<p>When Mr. Gray came in the matter was
talked over again, and he did not appear to be
very anxious that the fugitives should be captured.
On the contrary he discussed their
chances of escape with great composure, and
said he thought their prospects would be
brighter than they were if they only had somebody
with them who could show them how to
throw off the dogs. These dogs were not intended
to seize the fugitives, you will understand,
but merely to overtake and hold them
at bay until the soldiers could come up.
Large packs of trained "nigger" dogs would
sometimes pull down a single man when they
found him in the woods, and it is a matter of
history that some of our poor fellows who
escaped from Andersonville were sadly torn
by them.</p>

<p>But the four escaped prisoners in question
did not come near Mr. Gray's house that night;
or if they did, Rodney and Dick never knew
it. It was on the morning of the next day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
just as breakfast was nearly over, that the first
exciting thing happened. Ned Griffin rode
into the yard, and on his way to the back
porch he passed along the carriage-way in
front of one of the dining-room windows. Rodney
had a fair view of his face as he rode by,
and Ned looked through the open window and
saw Rodney; and in an instant a signal passed
from one to the other&mdash;a signal so very slight
that no one but a schoolboy would have noticed
it, but it told Rodney as plainly as words
that Ned had news for him that he did not
want to divulge in the presence of any third
party. So Rodney hastily excused himself
and went out on the porch.</p>

<p>"You look just as Rosebud did when I came
home last evening," said he, when he saw Ned
standing at the foot of the steps holding his
horse by the bridle. "But I hope you will
be more accommodating than he was, for he
would not tell what he had on his mind."</p>

<p>"Say," replied Ned. He looked all around
to make sure that there was no else within
hearing and then went on. "You heard about
those escaped Yankees, didn't you?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard all about them. What of it?"</p>

<p>"They came to our house last night."</p>

<p>"That's all right. You treated them white,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I treated them the best I knew how. I
thought you and your father wouldn't care."</p>

<p>"Of course not. But we would care if you
had treated them any other way. What of
it?"</p>

<p>"They want me to guide them to Baton
Rouge," continued Ned; and then Rodney
noticed that the hand with which he held
his bridle trembled like a leaf.</p>

<p>"That's all right too, and I don't see anything
alarming in it. Why don't you do it?"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly willing to do it, but you see
they have got Tom Randolph with them and
won't give him up. They are bound to take
him into the city as a prisoner, for they captured
him in uniform."</p>

<p>This astounding information almost knocked
Rodney over. He sat down on the topmost
step, rested his elbows on his knees and his
chin on his hands, and looked at Ned without
speaking.</p>

<span class="small">THE ESCAPED PRISONERS' STORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">"I tried</span> my level best to induce the Yanks
to let Tom Randolph go free, and so did
mother," continued Ned, slipping the bridle
over his horse's head and seating himself
on the steps at Rodney's feet, "but they
wouldn't hear to it. The worst of it is,
they scared the life out of Tom and made him
confess everything."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that," replied Rodney,
who had leisure, while Ned was speaking, to
gather a few of his wits about him. "If Tom
told how he persecuted unarmed Union men in
this settlement he's a goner sure enough, for
there isn't a soldier in the world who will stand
such work as that."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he said a word about it,"
exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>"Then what in the name of sense did he
have to confess?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>"About fighting those gunboats, you
know."</p>

<p>"He never fought any gunboats," declared
Rodney impatiently. "What do you suppose
possesses him to stick to that lie every
chance he gets? One would think he'd get
tired of it after a while."</p>

<p>"I asked him that very question when the
Yanks permitted me to have a little private
talk with him," said Ned, "and the reason he
gave was this: he had heard that brave men
respected brave men, and he hoped his captors
would treat him with a little more courtesy if
they knew that he was a valiant soldier."</p>

<p>Rodney Gray was utterly confounded.</p>

<p>"Valiant sol&mdash;&mdash;Great Scott! There isn't
a bigger coward in the Confederacy than Tom
Randolph!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But you see the Yankees don't know that,
and Tom has stuffed them so full of his ridiculous
stories that they imagine they have got
hold of a second Mosby or Morgan, and that he
is worth keeping."</p>

<p>"Did you tell them all this?" inquired
Rodney.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I did; but, although they know
that I am a Union man and down on everything
that looks like secession or rebellion,
they would not believe me, and you will have
to go up and try what you can do; that is, if
you feel like helping one who has always done
his best to injure you."</p>

<p>"I'd like to take Tom Randolph right out
there in the carriage road and punch his head
for him this minute," replied Rodney, "but I
am not coward enough to take vengeance on
him in any other way. I'll go, of course, but
I don't imagine they will pay any more attention
to me than they did to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, they will; for they know you."</p>

<p>"Know me?" cried Rodney, opening his
eyes wide with amazement. "I reckon not.
I don't know a living Yank."</p>

<p>"Well, they know you, and Dick Graham
as well," insisted Ned. "They remember
perfectly of reading your names on the discharges
you showed when they captured you
between here and Camp Pinckney."</p>

<p>Rodney Gray had got upon his feet, but
when he heard these words he sat down again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
He stared hard at Ned as if he were trying to
understand something that was too hard for
him, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Rosebud!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Ned,
when in response to the summons the darkey
came tumbling out of the kitchen with a slice
of bacon in one hand and a chunk of corn
pone in the other.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you to come into the
house and tell your story to Dick and the
folks from beginning to end," answered
Rodney. "Give your horse to Rosebud and
come on."</p>

<p>Ned Griffin followed his conductor with
some reluctance, for he did not know what a
man who had fitted out half a dozen partisan
rangers, and who was a large slaveholder
besides, might think of an overseer who gave
aid and comfort to Union soldiers and abolitionists
without saying a word to him about
it. The quick-witted Rodney must have
known what he was thinking about, for after
placing Ned in a chair and carefully closing
all the doors that gave entrance into the dining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
room, he walked up to his father and whispered:</p>

<p>"Those escaped prisoners were up to Ned's
last night, and he is afraid you will think
hard of him for giving them a bite to eat."</p>

<p>"And loaning them blankets too, Mr.
Gray," chimed in honest Ned, who meant that
his employer should know the full extent of
his offending. "They had blankets enough
first and last, but were so hard pressed by the
dogs that they had to throw away everything
except their guns."</p>

<p>"Well, I assure you that I don't think
hard of you for giving hungry men something
to eat and a bed to sleep on," said Mr. Gray.
"I should have done the same thing myself
if they had applied to me; but I trust you
exercised due care while you were doing it."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean, sir," answered
Ned, "and there isn't a white person living
who knows what happened on that plantation
last night except my mother and Tom Randolph."</p>

<p>A shell from one of the gunboats in front
of Baton Rouge could scarcely have created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
greater consternation in that room than Ned
Griffin's last words. Mr. Gray thought that
Ned's doings might as well be published in
Richmond at once, and was about to say as
much, when Rodney took a great load from
his mind, and astonished him almost beyond
measure at the same time, by quietly remarking
that Tom was a prisoner in the hands of
the Yankees, who were bent on taking him to
Baton Rouge. Then he requested Ned to tell
them just what had happened on his plantation
the night before, and the latter gave the
particulars substantially as follows:</p>

<p>The first Ned and his mother heard of the
escaped prisoners was through one of the
house servants, who declared with much earnestness
that she could not remember just who
told her the news, but it was in everybody's
mouth, and some of the field hands, she didn't
know who, had seen and talked with white
men who had seen and talked with the Confederate
soldiers who were following the trail of
the fugitives. She did not try to conceal her
joy when she informed Mrs. Griffin that "dem
Yanks was boun' to get safe to de ribber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
kase dey had done pass Mooreville de night
befo', and de houn' dogs had done been heared
givin' tongue in de woods ten miles from
Baton Rouge." Being intensely loyal to the
Old Flag and friendly to those who wore the
blue, Ned hoped from the bottom of his heart
that this report was true; but understanding
the negro nature as well as he did, he could
not believe more than half of it. He told his
mother that there was a conspiracy among the
slaves to shield those four men, and that they
might be concealed on the plantation for a
month, and no white person would know a
thing about it. Consequently he was not prepared
for what took place about an hour after
dark.</p>

<p>He was in the act of blowing out his lantern
after seeing that everything was snug for the
night. He had been the rounds of the quarter
to make sure that the darkeys were all in their
cabins where they belonged, had shaken the
padlocks on the corn-cribs and smoke house,
assured himself that his yellow-legged
chickens were all roosting high, and, being
entirely satisfied with his day's work, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
preparing for a quiet evening with his mother,
when there came a knock at the back door.
Ned opened it, and saw his negro foreman
standing there.</p>

<p>"Cæsar," he exclaimed, "didn't I leave
you at your cabin not more than ten minutes
ago? You ought to be in bed by this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sah; I was dah," replied Cæsar
with a chuckle, "kase I knowed mighty well
dat you'd be around to see if I was dah. But
I&mdash;&mdash;Step out hyar a minute, please, sah."</p>

<p>Ned went out, closing the door behind him,
and was surprised as well as startled to find
himself confronted by two men who carried
guns in their hands. The night was so dark
that he could not see their faces or clothing,
and his first thought was that some of the
Home Guards had come to pay him what their
commander humorously called a "visit of
ceremony." If that was the case Ned knew
that the house in which he lived would be
ransacked and robbed, and he himself given
notice to quit the country at once, or take
such a whipping as the old time overseers
used to give their negroes. But Cæsar's next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
words reassured him, although they did not
lessen his astonishment.</p>

<p>"You know dem Yankees what's runnin'
loose in de woods?" he said in a low tone.
"Wal, sah, Moster Ned, dem's um."</p>

<p>"We hear that you are Union, and so we
have made bold to come here and ask if you
can give us a little help," said one of the men;
and Ned noticed that he did not speak like
one who begged a favor. There was a ring of
defiance in his tones, which under the circumstances
was perfectly surprising.</p>

<p>"Who told you that I am Union?" said
Ned at length.</p>

<p>"The darkeys. We know the name and
politics of every man between here and the
place where we were captured. Just now we
are looking for supper and lodging."</p>

<p>"But I care more for a pair of shoes than I
do for eating and sleeping, although I am so
tired that I could drop down where I stand
and sleep for a week," said the second man.
"The hounds have driven us hard since we
got away, and I have worn out all the footgear
I could get or steal."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>"We had some blankets and quilts yesterday,"
added his companion, "but we had to
throw them away this morning in order to
make light weight through the thick woods.
We would have been in rags if it had not been
for our good friends, the darkeys."</p>

<p>"I can supply your wants, and shall be
glad to do so," said Ned promptly. "But
you must never mention my name where any
of my neighbors can hear it. Come into the
house, and Cæsar will stand outside to see
that no one slips up on you. There ought to
be four of you. Where are the other two?"</p>

<p>"We left them in the woods at the end of
the lane, keeping guard over a prize we gobbled
this afternoon," replied one of the blue-coats;
and when they were conducted into the
room in which Mrs. Griffin was sitting they
removed their remnants of hats respectfully,
and dropped with something like a sigh of
satisfaction into the chairs that Ned pulled
up for them; but they held fast to their
guns.</p>

<p>It took but a minute's time for Ned to explain
the situation to his mother, and scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
longer to provide for the immediate wants of
the two fugitives; for when Mrs. Griffin said
that they were welcome to everything there
was in the house, the half a dozen black heads
that filled one of the doors were quickly withdrawn,
and in less time than it takes to tell it
a plate filled with cold bread and meat was
handed to each of the hungry blue-coats.</p>

<p>"I'se mighty sorry I aint got some store
coffee for you, honey," said one of the women,
who by virtue of her age and position took it
upon herself to act as mistress of ceremonies.
"But I isn't got none."</p>

<p>"We're sorry for that, aunty; not on our
account, but on yours," said one of the soldiers;
"but it seems to me that you white
folks ought to be able to get such things as
coffee out here. There was lots of trading
going on with country people when we left
Baton Rouge."</p>

<p>"We've had a few things through the kindness
of my employer," replied Ned, "and we
hope to have more when I get a permit to
trade myself. Mr. Gray thought it wasn't
best to trouble the provost marshal for too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
many permits, for fear that he would shut
down on all of them."</p>

<p>"Well, the marshal will not shut down
on you, nor on any other Union man whose
name we have on our list," said the soldier
confidently. "We are not going to forget
our friends, I assure you." And then he
almost made Ned jump out of his chair by
adding: "You spoke Mr. Gray's name just
now; I suppose he is Rodney's father, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," cried Ned. "But what do
you know about him?"</p>

<p>"Not much, that's a fact; but we met
Rodney once when he wasn't at all glad to
see us. If we had been a different lot we
might have put him and his comrade to some
trouble, just to show what vigilant scouts we
were."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you belonged
to the squad that captured Rodney and Dick
Graham a few days ago?"</p>

<p>"We're two of them, and the others are in
the woods, if our pursuers haven't found and
gobbled them up. But I don't think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
have, or we'd have heard the sounds of the
fight."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll not go away without seeing
Rodney and Dick, will you?"</p>

<p>"That depends," answered the soldier, with
a smile. "We are not on a pleasure trip and
can't say beforehand just what we will do.
The first thing for us to find out in the morning
is whether or not our pursuers have placed
themselves between us and the river. If they
have, it might be well for us to remain in hiding
a few hours, and give them time to get out
of our road. But if they are still behind us,
we ought to push on without loss of time. I
don't suppose those two rebs would go back
on us if they knew where we were. They said
they wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Rodney and Dick!" exclaimed Ned indignantly.
"While they were in the army
they fought you Yanks the best they knew
how; but I know what I am talking about
when I say that you haven't better friends in
your regiment or company than Rodney Gray
and Dick Graham."</p>

<p>"I believe it," said the soldier earnestly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
"We are not afraid to trust any man who
met us in open battle; but the Home Guards
we <i>are</i> afraid of."</p>

<p>"You'd better be," exclaimed Ned. "The
most of them are sneaks and cowards, and disgrace
the uniform they wear."</p>

<p>"I believe that, too; and now let me tell
you why we are afraid of them. When we
met your two friends Gray and Graham, we
belonged to a squad of twenty men who
were under orders to scour the country between
the river and Camp Pinckney, so that
we could give timely notice to General
Williams if we discovered any considerable
body of Confederates in that direction. The
general has information that the enemy is
going to try to open the river again, and, of
course, he means to be ready for any rebs who
come this way. After we told Rodney and
his chum to go home and see their mammies,
we rejoined our command, which we found
about three miles down the road, and reported
that we hadn't seen any graybacks and no
signs of any; and the very next day we were
surprised and routed by a mixed body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
veterans and Home Guards which some good
rebel had put on our track. We gave them a
lively fight, but they were too many for us,
and those of us who were not killed or captured
were scattered far and wide.</p>

<p>"I hadn't much of an idea of being taken
prisoner, I tell you, and I have still less now.
I'd rather be shot and have done with it. I
had talked with some of our boys who had
had experience as captives, and the stories
they told were enough to make one's hair rise
on end. They did not have a word of fault to
find with the rebel soldiers, who, so they said,
always treated them well, but they gave it to
the Home Guards good and strong, and declared
that in future they would shoot every
one that crossed their path. I could easily
tell the Home Guards from the soldiers in that
fight, both by their dress and the way they
behaved under fire; and when I saw one of
our boys killed after he had given up his gun,
and saw that there was no possible chance for
me to get away, I just avenged the death of
my comrade by tumbling that Home Guard
out of his saddle with the last cartridge I had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
and hunted up an old soldier and surrendered
to him. My three comrades did the same,
and that's the way we happen to be alive to-day.</p>

<p>"We were kept with the main body about
two hours, and during that time were used
like white men. The veterans divided their
grub with us, patted us on the back, and said
we were good fellows for driving them out of
Corinth and licking them on the river as we
had been doing, and we had nothing in the
world to complain of; but I tell you we shook
in our shoes when we learned that nine of us
prisoners were to be sent to Camp Pinckney
under a strong escort of Home Guards, while
the soldiers kept to the road to hunt for more
Yankees. And right there is where I blame
the officer in command of the Confederate detachment,"
said the blue-coat, now beginning
to show such signs of anger and excitement
that Ned Griffin would have been alarmed if he
hadn't known that his loyalty to the flag was
beyond suspicion, "and if he ever falls into
the hands of my regiment he will have cause to
regret that act of his. He knew what manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
of men his Home Guards were&mdash;that they were,
as you say, sneaks and cowards, that they
dared not go to the front, and that their highest
ambition was to shoot a Yankee without
running the risk of being shot themselves.
But he told us to go, and when the order was
given for us to fall in, we had to obey it.
Well, sir, you may believe it or not, but I can
prove it, we hadn't much more than got out of
sight of the soldiers before those Home Guards
began laughing and joking about losing us on
their way to camp."</p>

<p>"Did they think you were going to try to
escape?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"They meant that they were going to shoot
us," said the man fiercely.</p>

<p>Ned and his mother could hardly believe
that their ears were not deceiving them.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, our Home Guards are
not as bad as that," said the former.</p>

<p>"Have they ever been put to the test?"
demanded the fugitive. "I know that they
have fought gunboats and defeated some detachments
of our cavalry, but did they ever
have a Yankee prisoner in their hands?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>Ned was greatly astonished to hear that the
Mooreville Home Guards had been in action
with the Federal cavalry, but he managed to
say that he didn't think they had ever taken
a prisoner. Before he could say more the blue-coat
continued:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to fall into their power,
for I believe they would make short work of
me. The men who had been detailed to take
us nine prisoners to camp came from the
Pearl River bottoms, and looked, acted, and
talked more like heathen than any men I ever
saw before. Believing that we did not understand
their jokes about losing us in the woods,
they talked freely among themselves until we
came to a place where the road forked; and
there they separated into two parties, four of
their number taking my three comrades and
myself down one road, while the rest of the
escort went with the other five prisoners
down the other road.</p>

<p>"Before this happened I had made up my
mind that I wasn't going to be killed by those
long-haired Yahoos if I could help it, and that
act of separation was two points in favor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the plans I had formed in my mind. It gave
me as companions three men who enlisted at
the same time I did, who had served in my
company and regiment all through the war,
and who I knew could be depended on to back
me up in anything I undertook, and it gave us
four the smallest escort, the main body having
gone down the other road with the rest of the
prisoners. And I hope and believe that those
five fellows got safely into camp, for the men
who went with them were not half as villainous
or blood-thirsty as those who guarded us.
To show you what sort of men we had to deal
with, one of them remarked, as he drew a big
knife from his boot to cut off a chew of tobacco,
that he wouldn't think any more of
sticking that knife into a Yank than he would
of putting it into a pig.</p>

<p>"I have been in some tight places since I
joined the service, but I don't think I ever
suffered as I did during the next fifteen minutes.
It makes me sweat now to think of it,"
continued the veteran; and as he spoke he
drew his crooked finger across his forehead
and threw off the perspiration which Ned saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
had gathered there like big drops of rain.
"Being the only officer there was in our
party&mdash;I was corporal, you know&mdash;my fellows
naturally looked to me to do something, and I
was fully aware of it; for I knew then as well
as I do now that they had one and all determined
to escape from those Home Guards or
die in the attempt. I communicated with
each of them by making the best use of my
eyes I knew how, and could have yelled with
delight when I saw that I made them understand
me. Each of us selected a rebel and
kept as close to him as he could without exciting
suspicion. I was impatient to get to
work, for I didn't know how soon they would
begin work on us, but I was afraid to do anything
until I thought we were well out of hearing
of the party that had taken the other road.
I was certain that there would be some shooting
done during the fight, and did not want to
draw their attention; but when I could stand
it no longer I gave a yell, and floored my man
as easily as you would pitch a bundle of oats
on to a wagon. I had him out of his saddle
before he could wink, and grabbed his carbine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
just in time to help Ben here, who wasn't
having as good luck as I."</p>

<p>"Did you kill both of them?" inquired
Ned, who was so deeply interested in the
narrative that he did not know whether he
breathed or not.</p>

<p>"We laid them out," replied the veteran,
"and as we were in something of a hurry, we
didn't wait to see how long it took them to
come to. It was all over in less than I have
taken time to tell it, and there wasn't a shot
fired or another yell raised. The fight was
carried on so quietly that a person standing
fifty feet away would not have heard it. We
did not waste any precious moments in congratulating
one another on our good fortune,
but carried the bodies of our guards into the
woods out of sight, dragged some brush over
one or two little pools of blood there were
in the road and over our footprints, thus
concealing all traces of the struggle as
best we could, and hitched the four horses
among the trees where they would have
plenty of leaves and twigs to browse on
until they were released; and then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
struck out for the bottom the best we knew
how."</p>

<p>"Whew! you have had a time of it,"
said Ned, as the corporal settled back in his
chair, clasped his hands over his knee, and
looked at his empty plate. "Lucindy, bring
some more grub, and pile on all the plates will
hold. When did you first become aware that
the dogs were on your trail?"</p>

<p>"We found it out the first thing in the
morning," was the reply. "Or rather, that
was the time we learned that the rebs were
going to use hounds to follow us up. We
slept in the woods that night without a fire or
a bite to eat, and at daylight set out to find a
negro cabin; for we knew that the darkeys
would befriend us if they could do so without
bringing themselves into trouble. We came
to a plantation after a while, and crept close
enough to the quarter to discover a negro
working about one of the corn-cribs. We
attracted his attention without much trouble,
but as soon as he made out who we were, he
disappeared so suddenly that we were sorry
we did not shoot him on sight, for we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
certain that he meant to betray us. So we
made a little detour and took up another position
in the field, from which we could watch
the doors of the great house; for there was
where we knew danger would come from, if
it came at all. By that move we came near
losing a breakfast and missing some information
that was of use to us, for that darkey had
no intention of going back on us. He slipped
around to his cabin, gathered up everything
he had in the way of grub, and spent many
valuable minutes in hunting us up. He had a
story to tell us, but was so badly frightened
that it was a long time before he could make
us understand that the news of our escape
had reached Camp Pinckney, that all the
soldiers and Home Guards that could be
spared from duty there had been sent in pursuit
of us, and that a big squad of men
had passed the house before daylight that
morning vowing that they would never take
us prisoners if they found us. They would
shoot us in our tracks to pay us for what we
had done to their comrades back there in the
road."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>"Then they were Home Guards," Ned interposed.</p>

<p>"Certainly; and that threat proved it. But
that was not by any means the worst news the
darkey had to tell us," continued the corporal,
placing his gun on the floor by his side,
and nodding to Lucindy as she handed him a
second plateful of bread and meat. "And the
part he hadn't yet told was what frightened
him. After much questioning he made us
understand that there were six soldiers in the
great house waiting for the breakfast that the
missus had promised them; and when they
had eaten it, they were going down the road
about half a mile after a pack of nigger dogs
that were to be put on our trail. And then he
assured us that if those dogs ever got after
us we would be gone up sure; for they were
smart at following a trail, having had lots of
practice in running down the unhappy conscripts
who escaped from Camp Pinckney.
That was bad news for us, as I said, and the
question at once arose, Should we take to our
heels and trust to luck, or would it be a better
plan to rush into the house and put it out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the power of the rebels to go after those
dogs?"</p>

<p>"But were you not afraid to attack them
in the house?" exclaimed Ned. "There were
six of them and only four of you."</p>

<p>"A small difference in numbers to men who
are working for life and liberty," answered
the corporal. "We talked the matter over
very quickly and decided, without a dissenting
voice, that we would put a stop to that hound
business before it had gone any further. We
would take our chances on surprising the
rebels while they were at breakfast, and be
governed by circumstances when we found
who and what they were. If they were regular
soldiers we would simply parole them and
let them go; but if they turned out to be
Home Guards&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The fugitive did not finish the sentence, but
shrugged his shoulders and looked at Ned and
his mother in a way that had a volume of
meaning in it.</p>

<p>"It did not take us many seconds to determine
upon a plan of operations," he continued,
"and then we crept toward the house under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
cover of the bushes and out buildings, telling
our friendly darkey to stay where he was till
the trouble was over, and no one should ever
hear from us that we had exchanged a word
with him. Everything was in our favor.
There wasn't a servant outside the house to
run in and warn the inmates that we were coming,
and before those six Johnnies knew that
there was a Yank within 100 miles, we were
in the breakfast room where they sat at the
table, and had them covered."</p>

<p>"And what did they turn out to be?" Ned
almost gasped.</p>

<p>"Regular soldiers, I am glad to say, and we
were saved a most disagreeable piece of business.
We told them they were in a trap, and
could take their choice between going to the
bone-yard and signing a parole not to take up
arms against the government again until they
were regularly exchanged, and they thought
they had better sign; and it didn't take them
a great while to say so, either."</p>

<p>"Had you any right to do that?" inquired
Mrs. Griffin.</p>

<p>"Not the least in the world, madam," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the corporal, with a smile. "But as
long as the rebels didn't know it, what was
the odds? We couldn't take them with us,
we couldn't shoot them, seeing that they were
not Home Guards, and yet we had to do something.
All we really hoped to accomplish was
to frighten them off our trail long enough to
give us a good start toward the swamp. We
knew their officers would tell them that their
parole didn't amount to a row of pins, but by
the time they found their officers we might be
miles away. There was one thing we were
sorry for, and that was that they did not have
their dogs in the house with them. They
wouldn't have followed any more escaped
prisoners when we got through with them, I
assure you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">A HAIL AT THE BARS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Although</span> the corporal talked rapidly,
he did not neglect his supper, and by
the time he reached this point in his story his
second supply of bread and meat was all gone.
He handed back the empty plate, rested his
gun across his knees where it would be handy
in case of emergency, and drew from one of
the pockets of his ragged blouse something
that looked like a small bundle of brown
wrapping paper.</p>

<p>"Yes, they concluded they'd better sign,"
said he, with a laugh, "and here are their
paroles. At first the lady of the house, who
was disposed to be impudent and sassy until
one of the rebs cautioned her that it might be
worse for them if she didn't keep still, declared
that she had nothing at all in the way
of writing materials; but when one of the
Johnnies told her, with some impatience, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
if she didn't hand them out we'd be likely
to go through her shanty, she produced the
stump of a pencil and some paper that was so
rough I could scarcely write on it; but I made
it do, and, would you believe it, one of my
boys had to witness their signatures, for there
wasn't one of the six rebels who could write
his name. Of course we disarmed and dismounted
them, and stood among the bushes
in the front yard and saw them make tracks
in the direction of Camp Pinckney; but the
hounds were put on our trail, all the same,
and the next day they pressed us so close that
we had to shoot some of the leading ones.
And what surprised us was that those dogs
would not attempt to follow our trail across
a piece of wet ground. They would take a
circle around it and pick up our trail again on
the other side where the ground was dry."</p>

<p>"They'll do it every time," said Ned.
"And it isn't a part of their training, either.
That's the way they hunt deer and foxes, and
it is something they pick up themselves without
any teaching."</p>

<p>"Well, it's pretty bright in the dogs, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
must say, and we were sorry to shoot them,
but there was no help for it. First and last
we must have killed half or two-thirds of the
pack, but they have been strongly reinforced;
for, judging by the yelping we heard to-day,
there are more hounds on our trail now than
there were at the start."</p>

<p>"You were very fortunate in being able to
keep out of their way," said Mrs. Griffin,
"and I don't see how you managed it."</p>

<p>"I don't either, madam; but somehow we
did it. We can't keep it up much longer,
however, for we are nearly exhausted, and I
wish from the bottom of my heart that we
were in sight of those gunboats at this minute.
But we'll get there in due time, and we'll not
go empty-handed. We made an important
capture this afternoon, and perhaps have saved
our scouts and gunboats, as well as the Union
people in the settlement, some trouble. It's a
fortunate thing for him that we didn't know
what he was when we first caught sight of
him; but as he was in full uniform we supposed
he was a soldier and treated him accordingly."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>"And&mdash;and what was he?" faltered Ned,
while his mother looked anxious and bent
forward in her chair to catch the corporal's
answer. Something told them that they were
about to hear bad news.</p>

<p>"A miserable Home Guard and a captain
besides," replied the soldier. "Of course
after he surrendered we couldn't shoot him
down in cold blood, as his kind would have
served us if we had chanced to fall into their
power, but we'll put him where he'll not fight
any more gunboats for one while, I bet you."</p>

<p>"How and where did you capture him?"
was Ned's next question. It wasn't the one
that trembled on his tongue, but it was as near
as he could get to it.</p>

<p>"Why, we had been wading for two miles
in a little bayou that brought us through a
cornfield to the river side of the road, and at
last we hid in a grove of evergreens from
which we could command a view in all directions.
We stayed there for an hour, listening
to the faint baying of the hounds in the
timber on the other side of the road, and never
once dreaming that anybody would come near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
us, when to our surprise we saw a gate open,
and a single horseman ride down the lane that
led straight to our place of concealment. I
tell you we were scared, for we expected to
see the dogs and all our pursuers come through
the gate after him, but he stopped to put up
the bars and then came on alone; and when
he approached nearer we saw that he could
not be one of the men we were looking for,
because his horse was fresh and clean, and
didn't have the splashed legs and body he
would if he had been chasing us through the
swamp for three days and more. We saw,
too, that he and his horse were at outs about
something, for every once in a while he would
pound the animal with his whip as if he were
very mad at him; and the last time he tried
it, which he did when he was within less than
a hundred feet of our hiding-place, the horse
jumped and threw him as slick as you please,
and I was glad of it. That was the time we
rushed out and took him in."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you his name?" inquired Ned,
and the words seemed to force themselves out
against his will.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he did; and we think it strange that
General Williams hasn't abolished him and put
a stop to his doings long ago. But none of us
ever heard the name of Captain Randolph before.
You know him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I do; and I know that, so far as
fighting is concerned, he is the most harmless
man in the country. Did he tell you that his
company had defeated some of your cavalry
and been in action with the gunboats?"</p>

<p>"He certainly did tell us just that," replied
the corporal; and Ned and his mother thought
he looked at them rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, there wasn't a word of truth in it,"
said the young overseer stoutly. He began to
have a vague idea that he was injuring himself
in the estimation of these two Federals by
standing up for Tom Randolph, but he had
gone too far to back out. He knew that Tom
would not have uttered a word in his defence
if their situations had been reversed, but that
made no difference to Ned Griffin, who in few
words gave the corporal a full history of
Tom's military exploits. The occasional raids
through the settlement that Captain Randolph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
had made at the head of his company Ned did
not regard as military business, for their sole
purpose was to intimidate Union men and increase
Tom's importance; so he said nothing
about them.</p>

<p>"If you are as strongly in favor of the Old
Flag as I have been led to believe, I don't see
what your object is in saying a good word for
this Home Guard," said the corporal when
Ned ceased speaking.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you say a word for an old
acquaintance of yours if you saw him in
trouble, no matter whether he was your friend
or not?" asked Ned in reply. "If you will
give me time I can prove that I have told you
nothing but the truth, and that Tom has deceived
you from beginning to end."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose his object was in
doing it?"</p>

<p>"He always does it every chance he gets.
He knows he will never win a reputation by
deeds of arms, and so he tries to win it with
his mouth. He never did you Yankees the
least harm, and he never will."</p>

<p>"Don't you think we have been here long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
enough, Charley?" Ben asked of his non-commissioned
officer; and he answered the
question himself by getting upon his feet as
if he were making ready to leave. He was
plainly the more suspicious of the two, and
showed in various ways that he didn't have
much of an opinion of one who had so friendly
a feeling for a Home Guard.</p>

<p>"We've been here too long," replied the
corporal. "Our friends down there in the
woods will think we are lost or have been
gobbled up. May we trespass still further
on your good-nature by asking for a bite
for our absent comrades?"</p>

<p>"Lucindy, fill up the biggest basket you
can find in the house," said Ned. "And Ben,
if you will sit down a minute I will get shoes
and stockings for you."</p>

<p>"And have you anything in the way of
bedding?" inquired Mrs. Griffin. "The
nights are cool, if the days are sultry."</p>

<p>No, they didn't have a thing except their
guns and the dilapidated garments they stood
in; and a blanket or two, if Mrs. Griffin could
spare them, would protect them from the mosquitos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
if nothing more; for of course it would
be dangerous for them to build a smudge until
they knew positively that their pursuers had
been left behind. Ben was profuse in his
thanks, and suggested that No. 9's would be
about the right size for him; and Ned went
among the darkeys to find them, for he wore
nothing larger than 6's, and couldn't boast of
an extra pair of them. While he was gone
his mother saw the basket filled and the
blankets made into a bundle, and also found
opportunity to say a word for Tom Randolph.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do with him?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Turn him over to the provost marshal and
have him sent North," was the answer.</p>

<p>"If you do that you will kill his mother,
and punish a man who is as innocent of any
military achievements as I am," said Mrs.
Griffin. "You must not think that I am a
friend of his&mdash;how can I be when he tried his
best to have my son conscripted? Why can
you not parole him and let him go?"</p>

<p>"We didn't parole those six rebels for fun,
or because we thought the parole was binding,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
said the corporal with a smile, "but
simply to delay them until we could get a
start. If we turn Randolph loose, it will be
out of gratitude to you and your son."</p>

<p>"Better knock him in the head," growled
Ben.</p>

<p>"Don't mind him," said the corporal, seeing
that Mrs. Griffin was shocked by the
words. "Ben is down on all Home Guards
because he saw one of them shoot his chum."</p>

<p>"But Tom Randolph was in no way to
blame for that," answered the lady. "And I
know that Rodney Gray would insist upon
his release if he were here. Promise me that
you will let him go; and when you are ready to
start for the river, Ned shall take you there
by the shortest and easiest course."</p>

<p>The corporal opened his lips to reply that
he did not think it best to make any promises
until he could consult the rest of his party,
but before he could utter a word an incident
happened that brought him and Ben to their
feet in a twinkling, and drove all the color
from Mrs. Griffin's face, leaving it as white as
a sheet. First there was a terrific and sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
outburst of yelps and growls from the small
army of coon dogs that found a home on
the plantation, and then answering yelps and
deep-toned bays came from the direction of
the front bars, mingled with the shouts of
command and the sharp cracking of riding-whips.
There was a second's oppressive
silence, and a strange voice called out:</p>

<p>"Hal-lo, the house!"</p>

<p>"Coming, sir! Get out, you whelps!"
shouted Ned Griffin's voice in reply; and presently
the frightened inmates of the house heard
him running around the corner toward the bars.
The corporal and his comrade, who stood with
their guns in readiness, seemingly as much at
their ease as they had been while sitting
quietly in their chairs eating the bread and
meat that had been provided for them, looked
inquiringly at Mrs. Griffin.</p>

<p>"They are strangers and have hounds with
them," said the latter, in a terrified whisper.
"I fear the worst, but Ned will do what he
can."</p>

<p>"I certainly hope he will keep them out
of the house," answered the corporal calmly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
"for if he don't, some of them will never see
the sun rise again."</p>

<p>Ned Griffin, who had had no trouble at all
in inducing one of the field hands to hand over
a pair of stockings and his best shoes for the
benefit of the bare-footed soldier in the house,
was almost ready to drop when he heard that
racket at the front bars, but he answered the
hail without an instant's hesitation, tossing
the stockings and shoes into the nearest bush,
and ran to the road, knowing that he would
meet a party of Confederate soldiers and a
pack of "nigger" dogs when he got there;
but did the soldiers know or suspect that the
men of whom they were in pursuit had sought
aid and comfort in that house?</p>

<p>"They can't know it or suspect it, unless
somebody has betrayed us; and if that has
happened it is all up with Ned Griffin,"
thought the young overseer; and when he
reached the bars and caught sight of the party
on the other side, he did not feign surprise,
but said, as any other honest, hospitable
boy would have done: "Alight and hitch.
I knew it was you the minute I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
the music of your hounds. Did you catch
them?"</p>

<p>"No," replied one of the men, who wore
some sort of insignia on his collar to show
that he was an officer. "They gave us the
slip about eleven o'clock this morning, and we
haven't been able to find their tracks since.
But we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say!" interrupted Ned suddenly.
"Please don't let your big hounds come over
the fence and eat up my pups. I need them
to catch wild hogs with next winter."</p>

<p>That was very true, but it was not the reason
Ned did not want the hounds to come inside the
yard. He was afraid that some of them might
go foraging on their own hook; and if they
wandered around to the back door in search
of something to eat, they could not help striking
the trail the two escaped prisoners made
when they entered the house. They would be
sure to recognize it on the instant and give
tongue, and then there would be trouble
indeed; for Ben and the corporal would fight
till they dropped before they would be recaptured.
And then what would be done to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
and his mother for feeding and trying to conceal
them? But the hounds were thrashed
and scolded back into the road and the officer
continued:</p>

<p>"We will get the start of them to-morrow.
If they are in this neighborhood they will stay
here, for we are going to place ourselves between
them and the river. But we were well
fed and rested at a house three miles back, so
we'll not alight, thank you. Are we on the
road to Mooreville? That's what I called you
out for."</p>

<p>"Keep straight ahead, and you can't miss
it," said Ned. "And if you want to go
toward the Mississippi, take the first right-hand
road. But look out for the Yanks. I
haven't seen any of their critter fellers, but
there may be some between here and Baton
Rouge."</p>

<p>"If we run on to them before we know it,
it will be our fault, won't it? Good-night.
Forward, trot, gallop!"</p>

<p>The young overseer, feeling as if a mountain
had been removed from his shoulders,
stood leaning on the bars until the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
the horses' feet had died away in the distance,
and then he settled himself into a comfortable
position, drew a long breath, and waited fifteen
minutes longer in order to make sure that the
rebels had really gone on toward Mooreville.
While he was waiting Cæsar came up, expecting
to receive a good scolding, and perhaps
something worse, for neglect of duty.</p>

<p>"Sho's you live, Marse Ned, I watch and
wait wid all my eyes and ears, and dey slip
along de road and up to de bars 'fore I knowed
it," he said earnestly. "You know ole
Cæsar aint going to sleep wid two Yankees in
de house and rebels all around."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I was out of doors, and
didn't know they were at the bars until they
hailed. Now, stay right here and see that
they don't steal a march on us. If you hear
the slightest sound down the road Mooreville
way, slip into the house and let me know it."</p>

<p>Ned went back to the bushes where he left
the stockings and shoes, and when he carried
them into the house he found no one there
except his mother, who was plying her needle
as if nothing had happened. The two fugitives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
had disappeared, and there was not a
darkey to be seen.</p>

<p>"Open that door and you will find them,"
said Mrs. Griffin, when Ned stopped and
looked all around. "They thought they
would rather fight it out downstairs than
in the garret, for they would have a better
chance to run."</p>

<p>"They can't go any farther to-night, for
their pursuers are riding hard to get between
them and the river, and may send the hounds
into the woods at any time. And I am glad
of it," whispered Ned. "I'd like to keep
them until I can go for Rodney. Perhaps he
can do something for Tom Randolph. Why,
mother, did you ever hear of such a lunatic?
If he gets out of this scrape I don't think he'll
ever let his tongue bring him into another."</p>

<p>Ned pushed open the door, and the two
escaped prisoners came out. In few words
they were made acquainted with the result of
the interview that had taken place at the bars,
and Ned and his mother did not wonder that
it had a depressing effect upon them. After
racing through the almost impassable woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and swamps until they were ready to drop
with fatigue, it certainly <i>was</i> disheartening
to know that the enemy had come so close to
them when they imagined themselves safe for
the night. They decided that they had better
return to their companions at once and talk
the situation over with them.</p>

<p>"All right," said Ned. "I will go with
you, for I want to see what Tom Randolph
has to say for himself. If you will take my
advice, you will stay pretty close about this
plantation until you have seen Rodney Gray.
He can do more for you than almost anybody
else in these parts, and if you get into trouble
you'll find it so."</p>

<p>The blankets and the basket of provisions
were brought from the room in which they
had been hastily concealed, and the fugitives
lingered a moment to shake hands with Mrs.
Griffin and tell her how grateful they were
for the generous treatment they had received
at her hands and her son's.</p>

<p>"There is one way in which you can show
it," replied Ned's mother, "and that is by releasing
your prisoner."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<p>"But, madam, we have no right to do it,"
said Ben, who was inclined to put more faith
in Tom's story of his exploits than he did
in Ned's. It was natural, under the circumstances,
for him to believe that Ned's regard
for the truth was not so strong as his desire to
shield an old acquaintance. "We are bound
to take him before our colonel and state the
case to him; and if <i>he</i> has a mind to let him
go&mdash;why, all right."</p>

<p>"Haven't you the same right to release
Tom Randolph that you had to release Rodney
Gray and his friend?" inquired Mrs.
Griffin. "You did not think it necessary to
take them before an officer?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did stretch my authority just
a little," said the corporal, coming to Ben's
assistance. "But almost any non-com., who
wanted to be half white, would have done the
same thing. Rodney and Graham had discharges
in their pockets, while this man Randolph
holds a commission as captain of Home
Guards at this minute. But we'll tell the
boys what you have done for us, Mrs. Griffin,
and let them decide the matter. I hope it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
may be our good fortune to meet again under
pleasanter circumstances. Good-night."</p>

<p>Ned led the way from the house and along
the lane that ran through the negro quarter to
the woods, in which the corporal's two comrades
and their prisoner were impatiently
awaiting their return. They moved silently
and without exchanging a word above a
whisper, but the dark-skinned inmates of the
cabins seemed to be on the watch. One door
after another was softly opened, and suppressed
voices, that were rendered husky by
emotion, cheered them with such expressions
as:</p>

<p>"Lawd bress Marse Linkum's sojer boys!
Youse boun' to whop de rebels, honey; I
know you is, kase Ise praying for you free
times a day, like Dan'l in de lion's den."</p>

<p>"I certainly hope you'll not get into any
trouble through what you have done for us
to-night," said hard-hearted Ben, who was
moved in spite of himself by these expressions
of sympathy.</p>

<p>"So far as I know, our blacks are all loyal,"
answered Ned, "but it won't do to trust some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
negroes too far, any more than it will do to
trust some white people; and when we are
in the presence of Tom Randolph I wish you
would be careful not to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, but it was too late.
He had committed himself. As he afterward
told his friend Rodney, he came near ruining
everything before he thought what he was
doing.</p>

<p>"There you have it!" exclaimed Ben
angrily. "Why do you try to befriend that
man Randolph, when you dare not trust him
for fear that he will set your rebel neighbors
against you? He shall never go free with my
consent, and that is a word with a bark on it."</p>

<p>"Or are you afraid that he will get his
Home Guards together and burn you out, to
pay you for what you have done for us Yankees?"
said the corporal. "I don't believe
there's a Home Guard in the world that will
do to tie to, and I think the best thing we can
do is to hold fast to that fellow. If he's done us
half the damage he says he has, he is a prize."</p>

<p>Ned's common sense told him that words
would not rectify the big mistake he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
made, so he dropped Tom Randolph, entirely,
and talked of the hounds and the risk his Yankee
friends would incur if they tried to make
their way to the Mississippi through the comparatively
open country that lay before them.
There were not woods enough to conceal their
movements; the people along the route were
mostly rebels, and they could hardly help
meeting someone who would put their pursuers
on their track if he saw half a chance.
What they needed more than anything else
during the rest of their journey was a guide
known to be a good Confederate, but friendly
enough to Yanks to help them out of trouble
if they got into it. The two fugitives did not
think they were likely to fall into such trouble
as Ned hinted at, but the next day they were
obliged to confess that he knew what he was
talking about.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the fence that
ran across the end of the lane and shut it off
from the woods, and there Ben and the corporal
stopped as if expecting something. It
came presently in the shape of the challenge
given in low tones:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> comes there?"</p>

<p>"Friends with the countersign," replied the
corporal.</p>

<p>"Halt, friends. Advance one with the
countersign, and have your head blown off if
you don't give it right," continued the voice;
and although the words seemed to be spoken
in a jest, Ben and Ned remained by the fence
while the corporal climbed over it and disappeared
in the bushes. A moment afterward
he called to them to come on, and when Ned
joined him he knew that he was in the presence
of the other two fugitives and Tom Randolph.
It was made plain to him at once that
Tom had sent the corporal and his comrade to
the house with the assurance that they would
find Union people there and plenty to eat, for
Tom said:</p>

<p>"Did you find Griffin?"</p>

<p>"They not only found me, but brought me
here to see you," said Ned, answering for
himself, and working his way slowly through
the dark in the direction from which Tom's
voice came. "And I am sorry to find you in
this fix."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Randolph may have borne up
bravely enough while he was alone with his
captors, but the sound of a familiar voice and
the warm grasp of Ned's hand unnerved him
completely. He drew the young overseer to
a seat on a log beside him, rested his head
against his shoulder, and shook as if he had
the ague; but whether it was with fear, or
with the violence of the struggle he was making
to keep up the character he had so foolishly
assumed, Ned could not tell. There had
been a time when Tom Randolph would have
been ashamed to rest his head against an
overseer's shoulder; but he was pretty well
humbled now. It was at this juncture that
Ned was allowed a few minutes' talk with
Tom, the soldiers being busy with their own
affairs&mdash;two of them in describing what had
happened at the house, and the others in disposing
of the contents of the provision basket.</p>

<p>"Tom," said Ned, "you never told these
Yankees that you had whipped their cavalry
and fought the gunboats."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," answered the captive; and
the overseer was not much surprised to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
that his voice was choked with sobs. "I took
them for brave men, and thought they would
extend a brave man's treatment to me if they
knew me to be a loyal soldier of the Confederacy."</p>

<p>"Well, do you know that you have got
yourself in a scrape that may end in your
being sent to a Northern prison?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tell me that," gasped Tom.
"That's what they have been threatening me
with, and you must make them let me go.
You can do it, for you are known to be Union,
and my father will reward you beyond&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you are not a loyal soldier of the
Confederacy," continued Ned, who wasn't befriending
Tom in the hope of making anything
out of it. "You are nothing but a
Home Guard; and these men have reason to
hate Home Guards."</p>

<p>"I know it," groaned Tom. "But am I to
blame for anything those Pearl River heathen
did to them? You are my only hope, Ned,
and you'll have to get me out of this. You
must."</p>

<p>"There's no must about it. I have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
everything I could, and so has mother. Your
only hope is Rodney Gray."</p>

<p>"Then send for him," said Tom nervously.
"Send for him at once, and say that if he will
stand by me now, he can command me and my
father ever afterward. I wish the men who
are responsible for this war were here in my
place and sentenced to be shot at sunrise. I
have been deceived and badgered ever since
I sided with the Confederacy; I've stuck by
her through thick and thin, while those who
deserted her at the first sign of disaster are
hail-fellows well met with the Yanks in Baton
Rouge, and live on the best the land affords.
They have salt and tea and coffee in their
houses, and white flour; and we have none.
You must help me out, Ned."</p>

<p>Tom Randolph continued to talk in this
rambling way until the corporal interrupted
him with:</p>

<p>"Well, boys, we have decided to stay here
to-night."</p>

<p>"And will you let Griffin go for Rodney
Gray the first thing in the morning?" exclaimed
Tom.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>"Griffin isn't a prisoner, and can go and
come as he likes," replied the non-commissioned
officer indifferently. "It's a matter
that concerns you more than it does us. If
Griffin has a mind to go or send for Rodney
Gray, we shall be glad to see him."</p>

<p>"These are the Yanks who captured Rodney
and Graham while they were on their way
home," whispered Ned. "That's why I say
that Rodney can help you if anybody can."
Then, without giving Tom a chance to express
his surprise, he said aloud: "What's the use,
Yanks, of staying here all night in the dark
and cold? If you will come to the quarter,
I will give you a tight cabin and a bright fire
to cheer you up."</p>

<p>The offer was a tempting one to men situated
as they were, but after a short consultation
with his comrades the corporal thought
they had better not accept it; they would
feel safer and sleep more soundly right there
in the woods. Then Ned suggested that they
should wrap themselves in the blankets and
get what rest they could while he stood guard,
and to his surprise and Tom Randolph's unbouded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
delight, the proposition was accepted
without an instant's hesitation. To keep up
appearances Tom took the blanket that was
passed to him and rolled himself up in it; but
he had no intention of going to sleep. He had
another idea in his head, and it was just about
as foolish as his notion of trying to pass himself
off for a soldier when he was nothing but
a Home Guard.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Johnny; and many thanks
for that grub and this warm blanket," said
one of the escaped prisoners who had not
spoken before.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Yank, and welcome," replied
Ned. "But I am not a Johnny."</p>

<p>"And neither am I a Yank," said the
soldier. "I came from Michigan. But good-night."</p>

<p>After that silence reigned in that dark, lonesome
camp for the space of half an hour. The
soldiers were weary and sank into a deep
slumber almost as soon as they had adjusted
their blankets to suit them; but Tom Randolph
was wide awake. He curbed his impatience
until the heavy breathing of his captors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
told him that they were in a state of unconsciousness,
and then said cautiously:</p>

<p>"Ned, Ned! Have you got a gun?"</p>

<p>"No. What do I want of a gun?" was the
answer.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Wrapped up in the blankets with the
soldiers, most likely."</p>

<p>"Well, say, Ned; look here," whispered
Tom coaxingly.</p>

<p>"It's no use, for I can't do it," replied Ned,
who knew what the captive was about to say.
"You don't show your usual good sense in
asking it of me, either."</p>

<p>"But you could drop asleep, couldn't you,
and let me crawl away?"</p>

<p>"I could, but I won't. I'm not going to
get myself into a scrape by going back on
these Yanks. They'd shoot me."</p>

<p>"But you might go with me," suggested
Tom, who was almost ready to shed tears again.</p>

<p>"And leave Mr. Gray's property to be destroyed?"
demanded Ned. "I said I'd keep
guard, and I've got to do it."</p>

<p>"Well, you have been weighed and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
wanting," said Tom desperately. "I know
just what you are now, but I was foolish
enough to think you were a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"You didn't think anything of the sort.
You knew better," said Ned; and after that
he relapsed into silence. He had proved that
he was ready to assist Tom in any way he
could, but he wasn't going to arouse Ben's
rage and the corporal's by permitting him to
steal away in the darkness. It was the most
senseless proposition he had ever heard of, and
he was glad that Tom did not trouble him with
it again. The latter lay so quiet that his
guard thought he was asleep, but he wasn't.
He was trying to think up some way to get
even with Ned.</p>

<p>Although the overseer was not at all drowsy,
the exciting events of the last few hours having
banished slumber, he passed a dreary
night on his log, leaning against a tree, and
listening for the first far-off baying of the
hounds, which would announce that the pursuit
had been renewed. But the hours dragged
themselves away without disturbance of any
kind, and at daylight the corporal threw off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
his blanket and sat up. He felt like a new man
after his refreshing sleep, and that was what
all his comrades said when they were aroused.
Then a short consultation was held, and Ned
posted off to the house with the empty basket.
It was full of eatables when he returned an
hour later, to learn that during his absence the
fugitives had decided that Tom Randolph's
story was more worthy of belief than his own.</p>

<p>"It doesn't stand to reason that a man
would tell such damaging things about himself
just for fun," said the corporal, who
spoke for all his companions. "He was as
defiant as you please when we captured him,
and I believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I told you a pack of lies; I did indeed,"
cried Tom, hiding his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"We don't believe it," answered the soldier.
"Your weakening is all put on, because
you have learned that it isn't such a funny
thing to be a prisoner as you thought it was.
And even if you did lie to us, you are a Home
Guard, and that is against you. If you
haven't done any mean things it's because you
haven't had the chance."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>To Tom Randolph's rage and disgust Ned
did not try to combat this decision. He simply
said:</p>

<p>"All right; just as you say. Keep a stiff
upper lip, Tom, and I will go and get Rodney."</p>

<p>This was the substance of the story that Ned
Griffin told while he was sitting in Mrs. Gray's
dining room on the morning of which we have
spoken. Of course he did not tell it exactly
as we have tried to, but he told enough to give
his auditors a clear idea of what had happened
on his plantation the night before. They
heard him through without interruption, and
when his narrative was ended they settled
back in their chairs and looked at one another.
There was one thought uppermost in their
minds: those escaped prisoners deserved their
freedom after working so hard for it, even if
they were Lincoln hirelings; and Rodney must
see them safe to the river. As to Tom Randolph&mdash;they
did not waste much sympathy on
him, but they were sorry for his mother. Tom
took just such chances as these when he put
on his gray uniform.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="small">CAPTAIN TOM SHOWS HIS GRATITUDE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">When</span> Ned Griffin brought his exciting
narrative to a close Mrs. Gray beckoned
him to a seat at the table and gave him a cup
of coffee, while Rodney sent one of the girls
to his room after a couple of overcoats, and
Rosebud to the stable to see the saddle put on
his horse and Dick's. He was elated over the
prospect of doing even a little to help the
Federal soldiers who had shown themselves so
friendly to himself and his chum, and determined
that Tom Randolph should not go to a
Northern prison if he could prevent it. Tom
was an old acquaintance and a near neighbor,
and that meant a good deal to Rodney Gray.
Ned was a little apprehensive that his employer
might not be altogether pleased with
what he had done, but to his relief Mr. Gray
did not have a word of fault to find.</p>

<p>"Rodney seems to have made up his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
to help those Yankees through," said he, addressing
himself to the overseer, "and I need
not tell you that I shall be glad to have you
do anything you can to aid him and them.
As to Tom&mdash;it looks now as though he would
have to stand punishment for his foolishness."</p>

<p>"And how about me?" said Rodney. "It
looks as though I was planning to get myself
into trouble. If I help the Yankees, my Confederate
neighbors will be down on me; and if
I help Tom, they'll <i>all</i> be down on me&mdash;rebels
and Union."</p>

<p>"How are the neighbors going to find it
out?" inquired Dick.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom will tell them," said Rodney
carelessly.</p>

<p>"And are you going to help a man who will
turn around and blab it on purpose to bring
you into trouble?" exclaimed Dick. "I
should think his gratitude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gratitude is the rarest sentiment in the
world, my dear boy, as you will learn long before
your head is as white as mine. He'll do
me a mean turn the first good chance he gets.
That's the kind of a chap he is. Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
got your discharge in your pocket? All right.
I don't know when you will see us again,"
said Rodney, when the overcoats made their
appearance and the horses were brought to the
door, "but when we return we hope to have
some better fitting clothes than these, and a
pass from the provost marshal. So, mother,
if you have any currency that you can spare
I shall be glad to have some."</p>

<p>These last words were whispered into the
ear of his mother, who led him to her room,
where she kept a small store of specie for an
emergency. Where the rest was Rodney did
not know or care to inquire. It was enough
for him that he could get a few pieces as often
as he found it necessary to ask for them.</p>

<p>"Now, do be careful," pleaded his mother.
"Suppose the hounds strike your trail in
spite of all you can do to prevent it, and the
soldiers with them find you and Dick in the
company of the escaped prisoners! Your discharges
would not save you."</p>

<p>"Don't cross a bridge till you come to it,
mother," answered Rodney, who had thought
of all this while Ned Griffin was telling his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
story. "We are not going into any danger.
Good-by."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the boys were riding post-haste
toward Ned's plantation. They reined
up to the house and turned their horses over
to a darkey as any casual visitors would have
done, for Ned told them that the rest of their
journey must be made on foot and under cover
of bushes and fences.</p>

<p>"There's no telling who may be on the
watch," said he, "or whether all our blacks
are as loyal as they pretend to be. And,
boys, don't say a word in Tom's hearing
about showing the Yanks the way to the river.
He'll take it for granted, of course, that somebody
is going to do it, but we'll make it hard
for him to prove it on any of us."</p>

<p>Rodney did not waste many minutes in comparing
notes with Mrs. Griffin (he already
knew everything she could have told him), but
threw his overcoat across his arm and motioned
to Ned to go ahead with the basketful
of things that had been provided for the fugitives'
dinner. It took them three-quarters of
an hour to reach the edge of the woods, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
slow and cautious were they in their movements,
and they found two of the soldiers at
the fence waiting for them. Rodney and
Dick recognized them on the instant, and
shook hands with them through the fence as
cordially as though they had always been the
warmest of friends.</p>

<p>"Say," whispered Rodney, as soon as the
greeting was over. "Call up the corporal and
the other Yank. I have a few words to say to
you that I don't want your prisoner to hear."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of him, too?" asked one
of the soldiers. "Then I can't understand
why you are so anxious to have him go free.
We can't leave him in camp alone, for if we
do he'll run off."</p>

<p>"He hasn't the pluck to try it," said Ned,
passing his basket over the fence. "But I'll
stay with him. You are not afraid to trust
me, I suppose, after allowing me to stand
guard over him all night."</p>

<p>But Ned hadn't told of the astounding
proposition Tom made while he was standing
guard over him. That was something he kept
to himself until he told his story in Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Gray's dining room. He climbed the fence
and disappeared in the woods, and presently
the corporal and the "other Yank" came up.</p>

<p>"If anyone had told me that I'd ever shake
hands with a rebel in this friendly way, I
should have said he didn't know what he was
talking about," said the corporal. "Johnny,
how are you by this time? You and your
chum must have got safe home or else you
wouldn't be here. You know our story, of
course, so there's no need of telling it over
again."</p>

<p>"No need and no time," replied Rodney,
"for you ought to be jogging along now.
You've an open and dangerous country before
you, and very likely every man in it is
on the lookout for you."</p>

<p>"That's about what Griffin said to us last
night," replied the corporal. "We asked
him to act as our guide, but he thinks you
can be of more use to us."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that; but I will do
my best on one condition."</p>

<p>Of course the soldiers knew what that condition
was, but listened patiently while Rodney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
went on to tell them that they never made
a greater mistake in their lives than they did
when they put faith in Tom Randolph's story
and rejected Ned Griffin's. He urged them to
release Tom without any more nonsense, and
hinted that the sooner they complied with
his request, the sooner he would be ready to
start with them for Baton Rouge. He also
added:</p>

<p>"If you are bound to take Tom with you I
can't go, and you'll have to do the best you
can for yourselves. He'd find means to let
my rebel neighbors hear of it, and then I'd
have to go among the Yanks or back to the
army; for I couldn't live here. What do you
say?"</p>

<p>"What do you say, boys?" inquired the
corporal, turning to his companions. "He's
a Home Guard, and a mighty mean one, too,
judging by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None of that, please," Rodney interposed.
"Having submitted the case, you have no
business to keep on arguing it. Yes or no,
Yanks?"</p>

<p>"I wish we had knocked him on the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
before we took him prisoner," said Ben, who
could not forget his lost comrade.</p>

<p>"But you didn't, and you can't very well
do it now," replied Rodney. "Are you going
to let him go or not?"</p>

<p>Ben did not answer; but his three companions
gave a favorable, though very reluctant
response to Rodney's question, and
the latter drew a long breath of relief. Ben
looked and acted ugly, and if he had been a
little better talker Tom Randolph's chances
for liberty and life would have been slim indeed.
As Dick Graham afterward explained
it, Tom was saved by Ben's want of gab.
Rodney's next care was to urge upon the
soldiers the necessity of sending Tom about
his business with the least possible delay, and
of being careful to drop no word in his hearing
that would give him a hint of their future
movements. Tom would make all sorts of
promises, but they must not put the least faith
in them, for if he saw an opportunity to do
it, he would put a squad on their trail in
less than an hour. This done, he and Dick
climbed the fence and followed the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
toward the camp. Ned Griffin had had time
to prepare Tom for Rodney's coming, and the
expression Rodney's face wore when he appeared
in sight prepared him for the good
news.</p>

<p>"You have prevailed upon them to release
me and I know it," he exclaimed, seizing one
of Rodney's hands in both his own and shaking
it with all his might. "And I'll never forget
you for it; never in this world. If you want
anything, all you've got to do is to say the
word, and if I've got it you shall have it.
And as for you soldiers&mdash;I'll cook up some
sort of a story when I reach home that will
stop all pursuit till you have had time to
reach the Union lines. I am very grateful to
you, and will prove it by pulling off my gray
suit as soon as I get home. If all Yanks are
like you, I am not going to fight any more
during the war."</p>

<p>Tom was sure he saw a faint prospect of
escape before him, and his joy was so great
that it choked his utterance. He continued
to rattle on in this way, until the corporal
interrupted him with:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all right, Johnny. So long as you
keep the hounds off our trail, it's all the return
we ask for setting you at liberty."</p>

<p>"Then you are going to release me, aint
you?" cried Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose such a thing was ever
done before," said the corporal hesitatingly.
"And I don't know what the boys will say to
me when they hear of it; but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That don't make any difference, Mr.
Soldier. You just tell me to go home, and I
will keep the hounds off your trail."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;git!" said the corporal. "You
will find your sword and revolver back there
in the grove where we hid them yesterday."</p>

<p>Tom lost no time in grasping the corporal's
hand and shaking it with all his strength&mdash;a
proceeding to which the boy in blue submitted
with very bad grace. He felt more like giving
his late captive a kick, and so did his comrades;
but they let him shake their hands instead&mdash;all
except Ben, who put his hands into
his pockets and turned away when Tom approached
him. Captain Randolph would have
persisted in his efforts to take leave of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
also, had he not been warned by a look from
Rodney that he had better stop his nonsense
and get away while the Federals were in the
humor to let him go. Acting upon the hint,
he turned away from Ben and disappeared in
the direction of the fence.</p>

<p>"If I am any prophet that surly Yank will
see the time when he'll wish he had not turned
his back on me in that style," soliloquized
Tom, when he found himself safe in the lane.
"I'll square accounts with him and with Rodney
and Dick at the same time. And Ned
Griffin, too. I might have given those Yanks
the slip last night, if he had been friendly
enough to fall asleep as I wanted him to do;
but he wouldn't, and now he will see how I
will pay him for it."</p>

<p>Tom sped along the lane as if he had been
furnished with wings, through the negro quarter
and up to the door of the plantation house,
where Ned's mother was waiting for him. She
had moved her low rocking chair to that door,
and had been waiting there ever since she saw
Rodney Gray and his two companions disappear
in the woods at the end of the lane; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
she felt the keenest anxiety for Tom, and wondered
what his mother would do if Rodney
failed in his efforts to have him released.</p>

<p>"O Tom, I am so glad to see you," she exclaimed,
as soon as the captain of the Home
Guards came within speaking distance.</p>

<p>"I am a free man once more, Mrs. Griffin,"
replied Tom loftily, "and it is a fortunate
thing for some people whose names I could
mention. If I had been kept a prisoner, my
Home Guards would have made sad work in
this settlement. I'll thank you to lend me a
horse. I want to reach home as soon as I can,
in order to relieve my mother's anxiety."</p>

<p>And this was all he had to say to the woman
who had done more than anybody else to keep
him out of prison. By her kindness and generosity
she had won the gratitude of Tom's
captors and made it comparatively easy for
Rodney to effect his release; and although
Tom did not know this, he did know that Ned
had done his best for him, and one would
think he might have had a civil word for Ned's
mother. Instead of that he hinted darkly
at some things he knew about "some people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
whose names he could mention," and Mrs.
Griffin knew that that was the same thing as a
threat. She replied that she did not feel at
liberty to lend Ned's saddle-horse without saying
a word to him about it, but Tom could
have a mule if he wanted it; and with the
words she went into the house, leaving Captain
Randolph to stand alone at the door until
the mule was brought up.</p>

<p>"This is another insult I shall have to remember
against the Griffins," thought Tom,
running his eye over the ill-conditioned animal
that was finally led to the door. "Now,
how shall I manage to have those escaped prisoners
captured with the least possible delay?
If they could be taken now, Rodney and Dick
and Ned would be taken with them; but I
don't know whether I want that to happen or
not. If it should get noised abroad that they
were captured with my help, or through information
furnished by me, I'd have everybody
in the settlement down on me; and goodness
knows I've got enemies enough already."</p>

<p>This was a matter requiring thought; and in
order that he might have plenty of leisure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
devote to it, Captain Tom allowed his mule to
walk every step of the five miles that lay between
the plantation and Mooreville. He rode
past Mr. Gray's house without stopping, and
in due time drew rein in front of Kimberly's
store, to find the usual number of lazy Home
Guards loitering about there doing nothing.
They were surprised to see him, for the news
of his sudden and mysterious disappearance
had been spread all through the settlement.
His father, who had spent half the night riding
about in search of him, pretended to believe
that Tom had fallen in with the soldiers from
Camp Pinckney and joined them in pursuit of
the escaped Yankees; but there wasn't a man
in the country who didn't laugh at the idea as
soon as he heard of it. More than that, there
wasn't a single member of the Home Guards
who had made an earnest effort to trace the
fugitives. The most of them paid no attention
to Tom's order to turn out, and those who
did, returned to their homes as soon as they
learned that the Yankees were armed.</p>

<p>"Why, cap'n, where in the wide world did
you drop from?" exclaimed Lieutenant Lambert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
as Tom Randolph rolled off his mule in
front of the store. "Have you been after
them Yanks? Your pap said you had."</p>

<p>Tom walked into the recruiting office and
met Captain Roach, who began to tell him how
his unexplained absence had frightened his
mother; but the commander of the Home
Guards interrupted him without ceremony.</p>

<p>"Before I tell you anything about myself,"
said he, turning to the eager Home Guards
who had followed him into the office, "I
want to know how many of you men would
like to win fame, and perhaps promotion, by
capturing the four Yankees who are roaming
about the country, shooting our comrades
down in cold blood."</p>

<p>"I would, for one," replied Lambert
promptly.</p>

<p>"And me!" "And me!" "And here
too!" chimed in the others; and they threw
so much earnestness into their words, and
seemed so impatient to learn how the feat
could be accomplished, that a stranger would
have thought they really meant to do something.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to see you so patriotic," said
Captain Tom. "And the way for you to
prove your words is to&mdash;you know where Ned
Griffin lives now, don't you? Well, go down
there at once, and you will find the men you
want at the foot of his lane."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" demanded Captain
Roach.</p>

<p>"Because I left them there not more than&mdash;I
mean when I escaped from them last night,"
answered Tom, who, now that the danger was
past, would not have sold his experience
for any reasonable sum of money. "You
don't believe it, do you? Well, it is a fact
that I have been a prisoner in the hands of
those very men, and narrowly escaped being
shot."</p>

<p>"But how did you get away from them?"
continued the enrolling officer.</p>

<p>"I knocked one of them down with the butt
of his own musket and took to my heels; that's
the way I did it."</p>

<p>This was going too far, and Captain Tom was
quick to perceive it. Some of his men exchanged
sly winks with each other, and turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
toward the door as if they had heard quite
enough of such stories as that, while Captain
Roach, who had put a little faith in Tom's
tale at first, sat down in his chair and pulled
some papers toward him.</p>

<p>"Continue to report regularly every day,"
said he, addressing himself to Lambert; "I
have received no official notice that Camp
Pinckney is ready to take conscripts, but all
the same I know it is ready, and an order to
send out a squad may come any hour."</p>

<p>"That's a polite way of calling me a liar,"
said Tom to himself. "I know where I can
find those who will take some interest in what
I have to say; and if I don't go there and drop
a bomb into this camp that will scatter it far
and wide, I'm a Dutchman."</p>

<p>He was too angry to say anything aloud.
He looked hard at Captain Roach for a moment,
and then went out to the hitching rack
where he had left his mule, the Home Guards
dividing right and left, and making no remark
as he passed through their ranks. He went
home with all the speed he could induce his
long-eared beast to put forth, and the reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
he met when he got there almost made
amends for the deliberate slight that had been
put upon him in the enrolling office; but the
best part of the story he intended to tell was
knocked in the head by the first words his
mother said to him. He was going to describe
a terrific battle he had had with the escaped
prisoners somewhere in the woods; but his
mother cried, as she ran down the steps and
clasped him in her arms:</p>

<p>"O Tom! Where have you been? And
how came your horse hitched out there in the
grove?"</p>

<p>Captain Randolph had forgotten all about
his horse, and just then he wished that one of
the Yankees had put a bullet through the
animal's head instead of tying him among the
evergreens. Then he could have said that he
did not surrender without a fight, and the
dead horse would have proved it.</p>

<p>"Some of the neighbors heard him calling
as they were riding along the road, and went
in and brought him home; but they saw no
signs of you," continued Mrs. Randolph,
looking hard at Tom as if to assure herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
that he was all there. "You don't know how
frightened we all were. The first thing I
thought of was those dreadful Yankees, and I
was afraid you might have fallen into their
hands."</p>

<p>"And that's just what happened to me,"
replied Tom. "I was a prisoner in less than
an hour after I left you yesterday; but I
made something of a fight before they took
me. I think I know where my revolver is&mdash;I
threw it into the bushes rather than give it
up to the enemy."</p>

<p>"Oh, you reckless boy, how could you do
it?" exclaimed his mother. "Come right in
and go to bed."</p>

<p>"And when you see that revolver you will
notice that there isn't a single cartridge left in
it," added Captain Tom, as he followed his
mother up the steps. "I threw away my
sword, too, but think I can find it again. I
didn't surrender, mind you. I was captured
at the muzzle of four loaded muskets."</p>

<p>"You dear boy! And how did you get
away from them?"</p>

<p>"I waited until they went to sleep last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
night. Of course they left one of their number
to guard me, but a Yankee is no match
for a gentleman when it comes to a fight. I
just knocked him down and cleared out."</p>

<p>"And wasn't you hurt a bit? Didn't they
try to stop you?"</p>

<p>"Of course they tried to stop me, and the
way the bullets flew was a caution; but the
night was dark, the bushes thick, and I escaped
without a scratch."</p>

<p>This was only the introduction to the long
story Tom had to tell, and although there was
scarcely a word of truth in it from beginning
to end, his doting mother believed it all. His
father looked slightly incredulous when Tom
told how he had laid around in the woods for
long hours while the Yankees were searching
high and low to find him, for his boots and
clothing did not bear out his thrilling narrative.
They were dusty, of course, but not at
all torn and mussed, as they ought to have
been if the wearer had had such a time working
his way out of the woods. But Mr. Randolph
was so overjoyed to see Tom back safe
and sound that he said nothing about it.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my son, you must quit the Home
Guards at once and stay right here on the
plantation," said Mrs. Randolph, when she
had asked her hero all the questions she could
think of. "When you are a private citizen
you will not be called upon to assist in capturing
desperadoes."</p>

<p>"I've done the very best I could for the
South ever since I joined my fortunes with
hers," answered Captain Tom; "I have risked
life and liberty in her defence more than once,
and am ready to do it again; but I can't fight
the whole Yankee nation alone and unaided."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," assented his mother.</p>

<p>"I was the only one of the company who
had the pluck to face those desperate men in
the woods," continued Tom, "and was captured
for my pains. I ordered my men out
to help me, but they never came. They left
me to meet the danger alone; and when I
dropped into the enrolling office on my way
home, they were loafing as usual and bragging
too. And when I told them right where
they would find those Yanks, and tried to get
them to go out and capture them, do you suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
they would go? They just as good as
told me that they did not believe me, and
Roach broke in on my story by giving orders
directly to Lambert instead of passing them
to him through me. I have put up with that
man just as long as I am going to; and, father,
if you will pay Larkin off and let him go, I'll
be ready to take his place to-morrow morning.
And now I'll write to the Governor the very
first thing I do."</p>

<p>This letter to the Governor, tendering his
resignation as captain of State troops, was the
"bomb" with which Tom had threatened to
"scatter Captain Roach's camp far and wide,"
but when he sat down to write it, the thought
occurred to him that if he said too much the
letter might operate like a boomerang, and
hurt him more than he hoped to hurt Captain
Roach. If he had written it as he had it
framed in his mind, it would have been a
complete and scathing indictment of the enrolling
officer's way of doing business; but
the letter he showed his mother, when she
came to his room in response to his call, read
something like this:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>I have the honor to tender herewith my resignation as
captain of the State militia which was granted me on
the &mdash;th day of April last, with authority to raise and
command a company of mounted men for home defence.</p>

<p>I have long been of opinion that partisan organizations
are not what we need in this hour of our country's
peril, and now I am satisfied of it. Our best men long
ago went to the front voluntarily, leaving behind them
a rabble who cannot possibly be made into soldiers. The
men under my command were selected with the greatest
care, but I am obliged to say that they are fit for nothing
but guard duty at Camp Pinckney. If they were ordered
there in a body, to take the place of better men who could
be sent to the front, it would be a relief to the community.
For myself I have other ideas, which I shall
proceed to carry out as soon as I receive notice that my
resignation has been accepted.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"That is nothing but the truth," said Mrs.
Randolph, after she had read the letter.
"But, Tom, I am afraid it will get you into
trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't see how," was the reply. "You
don't suppose that the Governor will bring
it down here, show it to such fellows as Lambert
and Moseley and the rest, and ask them
what they think of it; do you? He has other
fish to fry."</p>

<p>"But suppose he should ask you what your
other ideas are," said his mother.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<p>"There's no danger of that. If the Governor
thinks that my chief reason for resigning
is because I want to go to the front, well and
good. I am not to blame for what he thinks.
I have other ideas, and that's a fact; and one
of them is to see the men who winked and
nudged one another to-day when I was trying
to put a little courage into them, sent where
they will be held with their noses close to the
grindstone. Now I'll ride down and mail this,
and when the acceptance comes I'll tell Roach
what I have done."</p>

<p>"That reminds me that the mail carrier had
a race with a squad of Yankee cavalry yesterday,"
said Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Tom. "Have
they come as close as that to Mooreville?
They are bound to get here sooner or later,
but I hope they'll stay away a week longer,
for then I shall be a free man."</p>

<p>And Captain Tom might have added that he
would be glad to see the Federals at the end
of a week, provided he received a favorable
answer from the Governor in that time.
When the Home Guards were ordered away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
to do duty at Camp Pinckney he would consider
his account with them settled; and the
other old scores&mdash;there were four of them
now&mdash;could be attended to at some future
time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="small">RODNEY KEEPS HIS PROMISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">When</span> Captain Randolph was done with
his leave-taking he hastened away as
if he feared that the escaped prisoners might
change their minds and call him back. He
was out of sight in an instant, and when he
was out of hearing Rodney Gray said:</p>

<p>"Now we must <i>git</i> ourselves. I don't know
what sort of a story Tom will tell when he
gets home, but it is safe to say that he will
make himself out a very brave fellow, and
urge his men to take up our trail at once."</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble yourself about the
Home Guards," said Ned.</p>

<p>"I don't; but if those same Home Guards
should chance to stumble upon the soldiers
from Camp Pinckney, we'd have something
to trouble ourselves about, wouldn't we? So
I say we had better move away from here.
Pick up that basket, somebody; and Ned, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
take care of the quilts, for we'll not need
them. We shall lie by during the daytime
and travel at night. You haven't heard the
last of this morning's work, Ned, and neither
have I."</p>

<p>"If that Home Guard gets you into trouble
after what you have done for him, find means
to let the &mdash;th Michigan cavalry know it; and
the first time we scout through here we'll pay
our respects to him," said Ben hotly. "If
it hadn't been for Griffin's mother, Captain
Randolph would have gone to a Northern
stockade as sure as he is a living man."</p>

<p>"I'll bear that in mind," replied Ned.
"Good-by, boys. So-long, Yanks."</p>

<p>"May the best of good luck always attend
you, Johnny," said the fugitives in concert.</p>

<p>This parting would have disgusted Captain
Randolph if he had been there to witness it,
and might have led him to say: "This is
another insult that I've got to remember
against the Griffin family," for there was a
good deal of friendly feeling manifested on
both sides. Surly Ben did not turn his back
this time, but held fast to Ned with one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
while he pointed to the shoes he wore, with the
other, and said:</p>

<p>"If I get away I shall have you to thank
for it. I couldn't have walked a mile with
my feet on the ground as they were when you
took pity on me last night. If I can ever repay
you I will."</p>

<p>"You have repaid me a hundred times over
by letting Rodney and Dick go free when
you captured them a few days ago. So-long,
Yanks."</p>

<p>"Fall in," said Rodney. "Good-by, Ned.
I wish you would make it your business to
tell mother that you saw us safely off."</p>

<p>Ned began to roll up the quilts, the corporal
shouldered the basket containing the provisions,
and Rodney led the way deeper into
the woods, the soldiers coming next in line
and Dick Graham bringing up the rear; and
as he trudged along in silence he had much to
say to himself. Was this Rodney Gray, who
was risking so much to guide these ragged,
foot-sore men to a place of safety, the same
rabid Secessionist who once wanted to ride
rough-shod over everybody who stood up for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
the Union; who had not scrupled to bring his
own cousin into serious difficulty on account
of his loyalty to the Old Flag; who applauded
so lustily when the Mobile <i>Register</i> said that
Northern soldiers were small-change knaves
and vagrants who were fit for nothing but to
be whipped by niggers; and who declared he
would not pull off his gray suit until the South
had gained her independence? We said that
fifteen months' experience in the army of the
Confederacy, which never kept a single one
of the promises it made to those who enlisted
under its banner, had opened Rodney Gray's
eyes; and although he still believed in State
Rights, he did not believe in fighting for a
government that had deliberately gone to work
to make conscripts of its volunteers. Nor did
he longer believe that Northern men didn't
know how to fight. The way they thrashed
him and his comrades in Missouri proved that
they did.</p>

<p>Dick Graham was like Marcy Gray, Rodney's
cousin. He loved the Union and the
flag that waved over it; but, unlike Marcy, he
thought it his duty to stand by his State.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
When Van Dorn was whipped at Pea Ridge
Dick Graham was willing to lay down his
arms and give up the useless struggle; but
the government at Richmond wouldn't let
him. It made conscripts of him and all the
other State men who had enlisted under Governor
Jackson's proclamation, and ordered
them across the Mississippi to join the Army
of the Centre under Beauregard. Dick went
because he could not help himself, and did
his duty faithfully while he remained; but he
had his discharge in his pocket now, and said
there would have to be a marked change in
his feelings before he would swear away his
liberty again. There were many like him.
He thought of all the men in his company and
regiment with whom he had been on terms of
intimacy, and could not name half a dozen
who would have said a harsh word to Rodney
Gray if they had known what he was doing at
that moment. The most of them would have
done the same thing and been glad of the
chance.</p>

<p>Although Rodney exercised little or no caution
in threading his way through the woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
he insisted that there should be no talking
among his followers. The slight rustling they
made in the bushes might not attract attention,
because there were so many cattle and
hogs running at large in the timber; but the
sound of a voice would betray them to anyone
who might happen to be within hearing.
Their progress was easy enough until they
reached the place where the woods ended and
the broad, cultivated fields began, and then
Rodney announced that it was time for the
fugitives to halt and get a little sleep if they
could, while he and Dick went on ahead to
see how things looked.</p>

<p>"From here on there is little cover except
such as we shall find in blind ditches and
behind bush-lined fences," said he. "You
boys take a bite and a nap, and Dick and I
will go to that plantation house you see over
there, and inquire about our friends from
Camp Pinckney. I am somewhat anxious to
know where they are. Don't be in any haste
to challenge or shoot when you hear us coming
back."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know the people who live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
in that house," said Dick, as he and Rodney
started off, after taking leave of the Federals.
"What sort of a story are you going to tell
them?"</p>

<p>"I am well acquainted with them," answered
Rodney, "but whether or not their
friendship for our family would lead them to
do these Yanks a good turn, I can't say. I'll
not trust them too far till I find out. We'll
tell them the truth so far as our war record is
concerned, but we're hog and critter hunting
when they ask us what brought us into the
woods. And of course we know all about the
escaped prisoners."</p>

<p>Rodney did not lead the way directly
toward the house, but worked his way along
a fence until he reached a point from which
the dwelling could not be seen; and then he
and Dick climbed over into the field and struck
out across it without making any further
attempt at concealment. It never occurred to
them that possibly the little clump of trees
that hid the house might also hide something
else from their view, but such proved to be the
case; for as Rodney walked around the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
of the building with all the confidence of a
welcome visitor, he was surprised and frightened
to find himself in the presence of the
very men he came to inquire about&mdash;the
soldiers from Camp Pinckney, who were sitting
or lying at their ease under the shade of
the trees, while the master of the house and
his family moved among them with steaming
coffee-pots and trays filled with something
good to eat. Their hounds were lying close
by on the grass, their horses stood at the front
fence with their heads down as if asleep, and
both looked as though they needed rest. The
boys made a mental note of these things and
walked straight ahead as if they belonged there,
their approach being hailed with an exclamation
of delight from the owner of the plantation,
who was the first to catch sight of them.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir, by such conduct?"
said Mr. Turnbull, passing his well
loaded tray to one of the soldiers and hastening
to meet Rodney with outstretched hand.
"You've been at home five or six days, and
this is the first glimpse we have had of you.
Come up and have a bite."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span></p>

<p>Rodney thanked him and presented his
friend Dick, who was welcomed in the same
breezy way. Then they shook hands with the
other members of the family, and were made
acquainted with the lieutenant who commanded
the soldiers&mdash;the one whom Captain
Randolph had met and talked with the day
before. There was also a neighbor present who
had come over to hear what the soldiers had
to say about the escaped prisoners, and about
Tom Randolph, whose mysterious disappearance
was the talk of the planters for miles
around. Rodney was not pleased to see Mr.
Biglin, that was the neighbor's name, for he
was a red-hot Secessionist, who denounced Mr.
Gray for his moderate views, and declared that
every man who retained a spark of love for
the old Union ought to be shot on sight.</p>

<p>"Now I think we are all happy and comfortable,"
said Mr. Turnbull, when the boys
had been provided with plates and something
to put on them. "And that's better provender,
I take it, than you got in the army; eh,
Rodney? How do you like army life anyway?
And when are you going back?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>The lieutenant looked surprised, as Rodney
and Dick knew he would, and so they handed
over their discharges to prove that they had
seen service, and had the right to be at home
at that particular time.</p>

<p>"We're not going to be in any hurry,"
answered Rodney, who thought all his neighbors
ought to know how he felt on that point.
"Since I came home I have met many able-bodied
civilians who were fierce for a fight
when this thing first broke out, and who
haven't yet put on a gray jacket. When I
see those men in the front rank I'll go back,
and not before."</p>

<p>Mr. Biglin winced and glanced uneasily at
the soldiers, for these remarks came pretty
near applying to him, as Rodney meant they
should. Mr. Turnbull was exempt by reason
of his age, and he wasn't a very hot Secessionist,
either. His wife hastened to turn the
conversation into another channel by saying:</p>

<p>"O Rodney; did you hear anything of
those escaped prisoners in your neighborhood,
and do you think they have killed or
captured Tom Randolph?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p>"Small loss," began Mr. Turnbull, and then
he was checked by a look from his wife. The
latter knew that every word that he uttered
against Tom would get to Mr. Randolph's ears
by the shortest route, and she was afraid of
Home Guards.</p>

<p>"Randolph was down here last night looking
for Tom," continued Mr. Turnbull, "but
he told a story that was too funny for me to
believe. He said Tom had gone out with his
Home Guards to search for the prisoners, but
I know better than that."</p>

<p>"And Tom certainly did not go into the
woods alone to hunt for them, so what chance
had the Yanks to kill or capture him?" added
Rodney. "We know that they were in our
neighborhood yesterday, for some of these
soldiers told my mother so; but they never
came near our house."</p>

<p>"I noticed you did not come by the road,"
observed the lieutenant. "Have you been
riding through the woods back of this plantation?"</p>

<p>"Dick and I have been walking through
them, but not a horn nor a hoof did we see,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
answered Rodney. "You know, Mr. Turnbull,
that my father will have a big lot of
bacon and beef to pay to the government for
the exemption of two overseers; and just now
I don't know where he is going to get it."</p>

<p>"Ned Griffin is one overseer," said Mr.
Turnbull. "Who's the other?"</p>

<p>"I am. I never was a good fighter. I
think I can do the Confederacy just as much
service by working on a farm and raising grub
for the soldiers, as I can by staying in the
army. At any rate I am going to try it until
some of my neighbors leave off fighting with
their mouths and shoulder a musket."</p>

<p>"That's fair, I'm sure," said the lieutenant;
while the soldiers winked and nodded at one
another as if to say: "Our sentiments exactly."
Mr. Biglin saw it and it nettled him,
for he had done a great deal of fighting with
his mouth, but every dollar he gave to aid the
cause of the South was fairly squeezed out
of him.</p>

<p>"And while you are working one of your
father's farms, I suppose you will hold yourself
in readiness to help any destitute Yankees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
who may happen to come your way," said
Mr. Biglin.</p>

<p>If Rodney and Dick had been the inexperienced
boys they were when they first entered
the army, these startling words would have
knocked them out of their chairs. If Mr.
Biglin didn't know what they had been doing
that morning, his language and actions seemed
to indicate that he suspected it. If that was
the case, the information must have come from
Tom Randolph. He had had plenty of time
to reach home and spread the news far and
wide. If Mr. Biglin had been content to stop
right there he might have left a bad impression
upon the minds of some of his auditors;
but seeing that he had made Rodney and his
friend uneasy, he went on to say:</p>

<p>"I heard a fishy story about your being captured
by Yankee soldiers who were gentlemen
enough to release you."</p>

<p>"There's nothing fishy about it," replied
Rodney, greatly relieved. "I said that Dick
and I were captured and set free again between
here and Camp Pinckney, and it is nothing but
the truth. I said, further, that if I ever saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
those men in trouble I would try my best to
help them out; and I appeal to these soldiers
here to say if they wouldn't do the same."</p>

<p>"I would, if I could do it without bringing
myself to the notice of my superiors," said the
lieutenant; while his men nodded at Rodney
and one another as they had done before.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't," declared Mr. Biglin, in
savage tones. "And more than that, I would
report every soldier or civilian whom I knew
to be guilty of such a thing."</p>

<p>"I thank you for your words," said Rodney
to himself. "I know now that you'll not do
to tie to, and shall be careful that none of my
doings get to your ears."</p>

<p>Mrs. Turnbull saw that it was time for her to
interfere again. Two of her guests were becoming
almost red in the face with anger, and her
woman's wit or something else told her that
the conversation was taking a dangerous turn.
She had wondered from the first what brought
Rodney Gray so far from home on foot, and
now she believed that she knew all about it.
She moved her chair to the side of Rodney's,
and asked the young soldier to tell her a story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
of army life; and as she did so, her gaze wandered
through the bushes and trees to the
front fence, where she saw one of Mr. Biglin's
negroes dodging about, and evidently trying to
catch the eye of his master without attracting
the attention of anyone else in the yard. The
circumstance increased her suspicions, but she
said very calmly:</p>

<p>"Your boy Bill is out there in the road,
Mr. Biglin, and I think he wants to tell you
something."</p>

<p>"Then why don't he come in?" replied the
planter. "He has been down in the woods
trying to locate a small drove of my hogs, and
perhaps he has found them."</p>

<p>"And perhaps he has found something
else," was what Rodney's eyes and Dick's
said when they looked at each other; and
they could hardly conceal their agitation when
they observed that Mrs. Turnbull was keeping
her gaze fixed on their faces.</p>

<p>"You, Bill!" shouted the planter. "Come
here."</p>

<p>The negro came very reluctantly, and when
he saw his master turn about in his chair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
look at him, he stopped and twisted his face
into all sorts of shapes and rolled up the
whites of his eyes, trying by every means in
his power to make his master understand
that he desired to say a word to him in
private.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you speak?" demanded
Mr. Biglin. "Did you find anything down
there?"</p>

<p>"Sah? Oh, ye&mdash;yes, sah; I found sumfin,"
replied the negro, in a tone so significant that
Mr. Biglin would have been dull indeed if he
had failed to understand him this time. With
the remark that he had better be getting along
toward home he arose and followed the boy,
who promptly led the way toward the front
gate.</p>

<p>"Peculiar man, that," said the lieutenant,
rising from his comfortable couch on the grass
and stretching his arms. "He didn't even
bid us good-by. I reckon we'd best be getting
along toward camp. Boots and saddles!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to give up looking for those
Yankees?" inquired Mr. Turnbull, and from
the bottom of his heart Rodney thanked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
for asking the question. He wanted to do it
himself, but was afraid to speak.</p>

<p>"I reckon I might as well," answered the
officer, as his men got upon their feet, aroused
the slumbering hounds by snapping their
fingers at them, and hastened to obey the
command. "I did think of taking in those
woods on my way to Mooreville, but don't
suppose it would be of any use. If the Yanks
were there you two would have been likely to
see them, wouldn't you?" he added, nodding
at Rodney.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure we would," was the reply;
but after all he was not so sure of it. The
timber was thick; and, unless accompanied by
dogs, a whole regiment might have walked
through it without seeing any signs of a fugitive
who took the least pains to conceal
himself.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," continued the
lieutenant, "and as my men and animals are
somewhat worn with travel, I think I will give
it up and go home. I would have captured
those men yesterday if the Mooreville Home
Guards had been worth their salt. I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
have something to say to my colonel about
it."</p>

<p>While the lieutenant talked he shook hands
with the planter and the two boys, lifted his
cap to Mrs. Turnbull, and thanked her for the
excellent dinner she had given his hungry
men, and walked toward the place where he
had hitched his horse, accompanied by their
host. The latter's wife remained behind; and
when she saw the officer swing himself into his
saddle she made some slight apology to Dick,
and motioned Rodney to follow her into the
house.</p>

<p>"What's down there in the woods behind
our plantation?" were the first words she said
to him when they were alone.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Turnbull," began Rodney,
"how should I know? I assure you I am at
a loss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean, Rodney Gray,
and you can't deceive me," interrupted the
lady with so much earnestness that Rodney
saw it was useless to argue with her. "You
never in your life before came to this house
on foot; you were frightened when you found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
the soldiers here; you became angry the moment
Mr. Biglin spoke of Yankees; you were
frightened again when the boy Bill intimated
that he had a word to say to his master in
private; and all through&mdash;&mdash; Aha! You do
know what I mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Turnbull," replied Rodney in a
husky voice. "They are the men I promised
to help if I could. You'll not betray them?"</p>

<p>"I ought to scold you for speaking such
words to me, and some day I will," said the
lady hastily. "But just now I want to warn
you against Mr. Biglin. I am sorry to say
that he is not trustworthy."</p>

<p>When she ceased speaking she stepped to
the window and looked out. She stood there
a moment and beckoned Rodney to her side.
The Confederate soldiers had disappeared up
the road in a cloud of dust, and Mr. Biglin
was just riding by the house. It was plain
that he was in a hurry, for he did not stop to
pick up his hat, which flew off just as Rodney
caught sight of him, but dug his heels into his
mule's sides in the effort to make him go
faster.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p>"He's trying to overtake the soldiers!"
gasped Rodney.</p>

<p>"He certainly is," replied Mrs. Turnbull
calmly. "He will succeed, too, and when he
brings them back with the hounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Yankees will burn him out before he
is a week older," said Rodney, through his
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>"They will do nothing of the sort unless
you bear witness against him, and I know you
will not do that," answered Mrs. Turnbull.
"But waste no time in words. You know
what to do."</p>

<p>"I will say something in your favor and Mr.
Turnbull's as soon as I can gain the ear of the
provost marshal," said Rodney. "Good-by,
and thank you for the interest you take in my
Yankee friends."</p>

<p>Rodney made a sign to Dick as he sprang
down the steps and ran around the corner of
the house, and told him his story as they sped
across the field side by side. There was one
thing in their favor, he said. Biglin's mule
was one of those critters that gallop up and
down in one place instead of going ahead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
if the Confederates were moving with any
speed at all, he might not be able to overtake
them until they had gone a mile or two toward
Mooreville. But he would certainly come up
with them sooner or later and bring them
back; and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And then they'll put the hounds on the
Yanks' trail <i>and ours</i>," exclaimed Dick,
finishing his sentence for him. "Rodney,
you have got yourself into the worst kind of
a scrape by helping those prisoners."</p>

<p>"And how about yourself?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to skip out and go over the
river, you know; but you've got to stay here
and face the music. The lieutenant may not
be able to set Tom Randolph's cowardly
Home Guards on to you&mdash;indeed, I don't believe
he will try; but he'll report the matter
at Camp Pinckney, and that will be bad for
you."</p>

<p>The boys ran across the field at the top of
their speed, and scaled the fence without hearing
any sounds in the direction of the house
to indicate that Mr. Biglin had returned with
the soldiers. Ten minutes later they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
challenged in a low, peremptory tone that
Dick said meant business.</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> comes there?" said the corporal's
voice. "Speak quick."</p>

<p>"It's all right, Yank. I don't wonder you
look anxious," replied Rodney, as he and
Dick made their way through the bushes
and found the fugitives standing erect with
their guns in their hands. "Come on, now.
There's not a second to lose."</p>

<p>"Do you know about that nigger?" inquired
Ben. "Well, sir, he found us all
asleep and was onto us before we knew it.
We could have captured him easy enough;
but we never looked for treachery among the
darkeys, and besides we didn't know but you
Johnnies had sent him down with a message
or something. But the minute we spoke and
he ran, we knew there was mischief afoot.
Of course we were afraid to shoot him, and so
he got safely away. Did you see him? What
did he say?"</p>

<p>"We didn't hear what he said to his master,"
began Dick. "But we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You go to the rear and let me talk," interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Rodney, who had forgotten to tell
his friend that Mr. Biglin's name must not
be mentioned in the hearing of the escaped
prisoners. They would remember him, of
course, and square accounts with him the first
time their regiment was ordered out on a
scout. He managed to tell some sort of a tale
without speaking of Mr. Biglin, but it was not
entirely satisfactory to the corporal.</p>

<p>"You're shielding somebody, Johnny; but
if he is a friend of yours it's all right," said
the latter.</p>

<p>"What odds does it make to you so long as
you get safe to the river?" answered Rodney.
"I am shielding somebody, and I do it because
Mrs. Turnbull expects me to. That's
the name of the woman who lives in that
house, and if it hadn't been for her there's no
telling what would have happened. Bear that
name in mind&mdash;Turnbull; and when you are
raiding through here, don't steal so much as a
drink of milk from that family."</p>

<p>The corporal and his men promised, and said
the name over several times to fix it in their
memory.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>

<p>"Our pursuers are all soldiers," continued
Rodney, "and under almost any other circumstances
I believe they would let us off
easy; but the way they're fixed, they've got
to do their duty or be reported. They are
bound to come back to the house and put out
the hounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And they've done it," said Dick Graham,
coming to a sudden standstill and turning one
ear toward the house. "There! Do you hear
it?"</p>

<p>All this while the fugitives had been making
the best progress they could through the
woods, but now they stopped and listened
intently. Yes, they could hear it plainly
enough; not a single bugle note like that
which had attracted Dick Graham's attention,
but a whole chorus of eager yelps,
proving that all the hounds had taken up
the trail.</p>

<p>"This is going to be the tightest squeak
we've had yet," observed Ben. "How many
of them are there in the party?"</p>

<p>"About six hounds, I should say, and twice
as many men," replied Rodney. "Enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
altogether to make running easier than fighting.
Dick, take this bottle, and don't use it
until I say the word."</p>

<p>"What's in it?" inquired the corporal.</p>

<p>"Turpentine; and if the dogs get a good
sniff of it, it will spoil their scenting powers
for quite a while. The trouble is it evaporates
quickly, and Dick mustn't use it until the
hounds are close to us."</p>

<p>Dick fell back to the rear and Rodney set
off on a keen run, directing his course toward
a little bayou which he knew he would find
a mile or so in advance. But fast as they
went, the hounds came on at a swifter pace,
their sonorous yelps grew louder every minute,
and presently the encouraging shouts of the
soldiers mingled with them.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I wish I had enlisted in the
infantry," puffed Ben, who followed close at
Rodney's heels. "Such a tramp as we have
had wouldn't be anything to a foot soldier,
but it's death on a cavalryman."</p>

<p>"The hounds are now following Dick's
trail and mine across the field," said Rodney.
"They'll come on faster when they pick up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
yours, for they will recognize it on the
instant."</p>

<p>And so it proved. The hounds gradually
swept around from a point to the rear and left
of them to another that was directly behind;
and then their loud baying increased wonderfully
in volume. They had at last found the
trail that had been lost to them for so many
hours, and were holding a jubilee over it.
After that the horsemen were distanced, but
the active hounds came on with undiminished
speed, and in less than a quarter of an hour
could be heard making their way through the
bushes close behind. The prisoners began to
wonder if it wasn't about time for Dick
Graham to use the contents of his bottle, when
their guide parted the thicket in front of him,
and halted for an instant on the bank of the
bayou for which he had been heading.</p>

<p>"Put half of it right here and the rest
on the opposite bank. Forward, the rest of
us," said he; and with the words he dashed
through the narrow stream and into the bushes
on the other side.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small smcap">Dick baffles the Bloodhounds.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Dick Graham showed no little nerve in carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
out his instructions. When his companions
disappeared he pulled the bottle of
turpentine from his pocket, but knowing the
volatile nature of the fluid he seemed to be in
no haste to use it, until the leading hound was
so close upon him that he could hear his labored
breathing. Then he dug the heels of his
shoes into the soft earth and filled the depressions
with turpentine. Ten seconds later he
stood on the other side of the bayou, filling
other footprints with what was left in the bottle;
and just as the foremost of his fourfooted
pursuers appeared in sight, he flung himself
into the bushes. But he was not prepared for
what followed. As fast as the hounds arrived
upon the bank they smelt at the turpentine and
backed away with a sneeze; and when they
were all in plain view, running about with their
heads in the air or going through such contortions
as dogs will when they unexpectedly
encounter something disagreeable, a deafening
roar rang through the woods, and every one
of the hounds dropped in his tracks dead or
wounded. The Union soldiers were not going
to be tracked like beasts or criminals any longer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="small">RODNEY PASSES INSPECTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">This</span> was the first and last adventure that
befell Rodney Gray and his party while
they were on their way to Baton Rouge; the
shooting of the hounds "broke the backbone
of the pursuit," as Dick Graham expressed it,
although it did not put a stop to it altogether.
The rebels raised a chorus of angry yells when
they reached the bank of the bayou and discovered
their fourfooted allies weltering in
their blood, and fired their guns at random
into the woods in the direction the fugitives
had gone, but they made no energetic effort to
continue the chase after that. And this went
far to confirm Rodney in his belief that the
lieutenant would not have put the hounds on
the trail at all if it hadn't been for Mr. Biglin.
By expressing this opinion aloud he could
have made Mr. Biglin a beggar before another
week passed over his head.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span></p>

<p>Contrary to his original plan Rodney kept
his party moving until late that afternoon,
when he halted the soldiers in the rear of another
plantation while he and Dick went to
the house to get something to eat, and make
inquiries concerning their pursuers. This time
they were not gone more than half an hour,
and when they returned they were accompanied
by the owner of the plantation, who cordially
invited the soldiers into the house.</p>

<p>"It's all right, boys," Rodney assured them.
"Our friends from Camp Pinckney haven't
been this far down the road; Mr. Banks is
Union, and a large squad of your cavalry has
just gone back into the country, so that they
are between us and the rebels."</p>

<p>"Why, Rodney," said Mr. Banks, "you're
a rebel yourself."</p>

<p>"I was, and I don't know but I am yet; but
I am not fighting any Yanks just now," was
the smiling reply. "Come along, boys, and
after we have eaten everything Mr. Banks has
to spare, we'll take to the road and follow it
as though we had a right there. We've done
hiding now."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<p>The corporal glanced at the military pass
which Mr. Banks produced to prove that he
was "all right" with the Federal authorities
in Baton Rouge, and gladly accepted his invitation;
and for fear that he might forget it,
he drew one of those useless paroles from his
pocket and wrote Mr. Banks' name and Mr.
Turnbull's upon it.</p>

<p>"That's as strong a promise of protection
as a non-commissioned officer can give," said
he. "It will hold good with my regiment,
any way."</p>

<p>The four prisoners splashed a good deal of
water at the horse trough before they would
consent to enter the house and sit down to the
table like white folks, but when they got there
they did ample justice to the substantial food
that was placed before them. The planter
apologized for the absence of salt on the table
by saying that he hadn't been able to obtain
a permit to bring it through the lines.</p>

<p>"Then smuggle it," suggested the corporal.
"Buy a barrel of flour and chuck a bag of
salt inside of it."</p>

<p>"But don't let your best friend see you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
it," chimed in Rodney. "That's the warning
my father received. There are lots of traitors
in the city who try to curry favor with the
Yanks by carrying tales about their old neighbors.
By the way, don't you want me to get
you a barrel of flour?"</p>

<p>The expression of astonishment that came
upon Mr. Banks' face set the table in a roar.</p>

<p>"You didn't expect me to speak so freely
in the presence of these blue-coated boys, I
suppose," continued Rodney. "You needn't
be afraid, for they are not on duty now. Besides,
they are soldiers, and I'd rather trust
them than some civilians I know of."</p>

<p>"How will you bring the flour out?" asked
Mr. Banks.</p>

<p>"I'll bring it out," answered Rodney confidently.
"In the first place I'll ask for a
pass for inland travel and a permit to trade,
and I am bound to get both. I know where I
can borrow a team in the city, and I intend to
bring it out loaded. I know that salt and all
munitions of war are contraband, and that
there is an inspection of all persons and
property going in or out of the lines; but I&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
I shall be back this way to-morrow or
next day, and if you want a bag of salt for
your table you can have it."</p>

<p>"Well, I snum!" said the planter admiringly.
"Your war experience has done a
heap for you, Rodney."</p>

<p>"He had the reputation of being the best
forager in the regiment," said Dick. "I've
known him to stick a pig and clean him and
bring him into camp under Daddy Price's
nose, when the orders were strict that such
things shouldn't be done. If there was anything
to eat in the country our mess always
lived well."</p>

<p>Dinner over, Rodney led his party out of the
house and into the woods again; but it was
done merely to mislead any talkative rebel
or treacherous darkey who might be on the
watch. It wouldn't do to let all the neighbors
know that Mr. Banks had sheltered some escaped
prisoners in his house during the night;
but when darkness came they left the woods
and found in one of the negro cabins beds that
had been placed there on purpose for them,
and on which they slept the sleep of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
weary. Daylight the next morning found
them well on their way toward the city, with
a breakfast under their belts and a big lunch
in their pockets.</p>

<p>There was more travel on the road than
Rodney expected to see, and the number of
teams that were constantly going and coming
gave him some idea of the amount of traffic
carried on between the "invaders" and the
country people. When he and his companions
were halted by the first pickets a few
miles outside the city, they told as much of
their story as they thought necessary, and demanded
to be taken before Colonel Baker,
commanding the &mdash;th Michigan cavalry. In
order to avoid delay and the trouble of answering
the thousand and one questions propounded
by the inexperienced non-commissioned
officer who responded to the picket's
call, the corporal, who did the talking, said
that they were all escaped prisoners; but when
they reached the place where the &mdash;th Michigan
were encamped, and walked down the
street toward the colonel's quarters, that
story would no longer pass muster, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
corporal was recognized by his comrades, who
crowded about him from all sides. The news
of that fight near Camp Pinckney had been
brought in by a farmer, who affirmed that all
the Yankees had been killed by the Home
Guards as fast as they surrendered, and as a
consequence the Michigan boys had given up
all hope of seeing their friends again. Their
commanding officer greeted them in the same
cordial way, laughed over the paroles which
the corporal gave him, took down the names
of the Union people as they were read off,
looked at Rodney's discharge and Dick's, and
told the corporal to show them the way to the
provost marshal's office.</p>

<p>"But, colonel, these boys, who have stood
by us as though they belonged to us, want a
pass and a permit to trade," said the corporal.
"And if you will allow me to use your name,
perhaps the provost will be more willing to
grant the favor."</p>

<p>The permission was readily given, and the
colonel's name must have had some weight
with the marshal, for he did not detain Rodney
and Dick at his office on business for more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
than ten minutes; but he kept them there
talking in a friendly way for more than an
hour. When he handed them the papers
they wanted he took pains to say that there
were some things that could not be taken
through the lines under any circumstances
whatever, and then he asked where they intended
to make their headquarters when they
were in the city, and whether or not they had
any cotton to sell. As Rodney did not know
what his object might be in asking this question,
he answered it evasively.</p>

<p>"I wish I owned 1000 bales, and that it was
in the Northern market at this minute," said
he. "It is worth sixty cents a pound up
there."</p>

<p>"Because if you've got any you may as well
understand that it won't do you much good,"
said the marshal. "That is, unless you're
sharp. The Richmond government is going to
buy or steal all the cotton in the Confederacy
and make it the basis of a foreign loan."</p>

<p>"And of course you Yanks are going to
stop that sort of work by destroying every bale
you can find," said Rodney. "I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
that, but I don't know what you mean by
being sharp."</p>

<p>"You don't get the papers very often, do
you?" said the captain. "Well, take those
when you go. They're old, but perhaps their
contents will be news to you. You will find
that they say something about a 'partial
trade' that is to be established between
Northern men who are to have permits to
trade inside our lines, and <i>Union</i> Southern
people. Does that hit you? Anything to
cripple the rebs, you know. And you will see
something about the <i>Arkansas</i> ram in there,
too. It was a brave act, if it was performed
by the enemies of my country."</p>

<p>"What about her? What did she do?"
inquired Rodney, who had heard vague reports
that there was such a vessel as the <i>Arkansas</i>,
and that great things were expected of her by
her Confederate builders.</p>

<p>"Why, you know that the navy has been
keeping up a regular bombardment of Vicksburg,
don't you? I tell you the pluck of the
Johnnies up there is something wonderful,"
said the captain, and Rodney and Dick, disgusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
as they were with the policy of the
Richmond government, felt a thrill of pride as
they listened to his words. "They think the
lower river was given up too easily and are
going to make a fight for their city; and when
Farragut passed their batteries on the 28th of
June, and our shells were falling like hail in
the streets, parties of ladies were seen on the
court house and in other conspicuous places,
waving handkerchiefs and little rebel flags to
encourage their husbands and brothers and
sons, who were fighting the guns below them.
Well, when Farragut joined Davis above the
city they sent an expedition up the Yazoo to
find this ram <i>Arkansas</i> and destroy her; but
before they were fairly started they met the
<i>Arkansas</i> coming down."</p>

<p>"And didn't they capture her?" exclaimed
Dick.</p>

<p>"No, I am sorry to say. She either disabled
or dodged the three gunboats composing the
expedition, came out of the Yazoo with flying
colors, ran through both fleets, and took shelter
under the guns of Vicksburg. And she's
there now in spite of two desperate attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
that were made to destroy her. Sorry, aint
you?"</p>

<p>"I can't honestly say that I am," answered
Rodney, who had already made up his mind
that the talkative provost marshal was willing
to be friendly to any Confederate who had laid
down his arms. "A brave act like that ought
to be successful."</p>

<p>"Then our attempts to destroy her ought to
have been successful, for they were equally
brave," retorted the captain. "She got pretty
well hammered while passing through the two
fleets, and report says that as soon as she is
repaired she is coming down to take Baton
Rouge from us. But she is as far down as she
will ever get. Farragut is here now with his
whole fleet."</p>

<p>And this is a good place to say a word or
two more about the situation at Baton Rouge,
so that some events which we have yet to record
may be made perfectly plain. On the 22d of
the month (July) Flag-officer Davis made
another attempt to destroy the <i>Arkansas</i>,
but it resulted in failure. Two of his boats,
the <i>Essex</i> and <i>Queen of the West</i>, were commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
to go down and sink her as she lay at
her moorings under cover of the Confederate
batteries, but her picked crew fought as
bravely and skilfully now as they had done a
week before. The <i>Essex</i> ran aground and remained
there for ten minutes under fire so hot
that it is a wonder she was not cut all to pieces;
but she finally worked off and ran down to join
Farragut, while the <i>Queen of the West</i> struggled
back up the river to report the failure to
Flag-officer Davis. The situation at this time
was discouraging to our side. The gunboats
were widely separated; the canal that was
to make Vicksburg an inland town proved a
failure; General Williams removed to Baton
Rouge the small body of troops with which he
had been co-operating with the naval forces;
Commodore Davis went back to the mouth
of the Yazoo and anchored there; and for full
five months there was a lull in the operations
against Vicksburg. But exciting things continued
to happen in Rodney Gray's part of
the country.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, we of the Army of
the Centre always found more reliable information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
in your papers than we did in our
own, and I suppose that these you have kindly
given me will tell us all about the doings on
the river," said Rodney, continuing the conversation
we have broken off. "But I want
to ask you one question before I go. My
friend Dick wants to go to Little Rock. How
is he going to get there?"</p>

<p>"I give it up," replied the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you think the commanding naval
officer would permit him to cross the river if
he showed his discharge!"</p>

<p>"He might, and then he might not. I can't
say. Those navy men are fine fellows, the
finest I think I ever saw; but they're so <i>very</i>
particular that if I wanted to go to Little
Rock, and if it was right that I should go, I
wouldn't consult&mdash;I believe I should&mdash;well,
I'd just go. That's all."</p>

<p>"Well, we will no longer trespass upon
your time," said Rodney, getting upon his
feet. "We are obliged to you for your kindness
and courtesy, and if you ever come out
our way, drop in and see us."</p>

<p>"I should be glad if I could accept half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
invitations that have been given me by people
hereabout," replied the captain. "But just
now I can't. Any rebs out your way?"</p>

<p>"I don't expect you to come without an
escort. There are soldiers at Camp Pinckney,
and some of them have been seen in Mooreville."</p>

<p>"Good-by, if you must go; and remember
that there are a few things which that permit
does not authorize you to take through the
lines."</p>

<p>Rodney said he would not forget it, and
then he and Dick saluted and went into the
outer room, which was filled with civilians and
soldiers awaiting an audience with the provost
marshal. After looking in vain for the corporal,
they concluded that he had returned to
camp, so they took the nearest way to the
home of Mr. Martin, the gentleman under
whose hospitable roof Rodney and his father
were sojourning on the night that Ned Griffin
rode in from Mooreville with the information
that Drummond and Tom Randolph were laying
plans to have Rodney arrested when he
reached St. Louis. Mr. Martin was glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
see them, and made them feel at home at once.
He laughed when they told him of their interview
with the provost marshal, and, when
Rodney declared that he'd like to see anybody
treated with so much civility by an officer
holding that position in Bragg's army, cautioned
them to be careful how they trespassed
upon the captain's good nature. The latter
was cordial and friendly with everyone who
had business with him, but he had a reputation
as a fighter, had won all his promotions
by his bravery on the field of battle, and had
no mercy on civilians or soldiers who were
caught disobeying his orders.</p>

<p>"But smuggling things out of the lines is
like foraging in the army," said Mr. Martin
in conclusion. "The sin lies in being detected."</p>

<p>"That's all I want to know," said Rodney.
"I've never been caught yet. You can tell
me where I can borrow or hire a team, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Yes, the host could do that, and he might
also be able to make a few suggestions that
would be of use to them; but he didn't see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
how Dick would get over the river unless he
acted upon the provost marshal's advice and
"just went."</p>

<p>"However," he said, after a moment's reflection,
"I will introduce you to our mail
carrier, if he will let me."</p>

<p>"Do we have a mail carried back and forth
under the noses of these gunboats?" exclaimed
Dick.</p>

<p>"I don't know how or where it goes, but we
certainly have communication with the opposite
shore. The service was very irregular
while General Williams was at Vicksburg,
but since he came back to Baton Rouge our
mail reaches us at shorter intervals; so I
imagine it is carried across at some point up
the river and brought down through the country.
I don't know, but I meet the mail carrier
once in a while."</p>

<p>"And can you make it convenient to say a
word to him about Dick?"</p>

<p>"I can and will; but I must tell you now
that there is one thing that will operate
against you. You told the provost marshal
that you would make your headquarters at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
my house as often as you came to town,
and he knows me to be a Southern sympathizer."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Rodney, while Dick
looked frightened. "Mr. Martin, we will
never come near your house again."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will," replied their host.
"But you must be careful how you act and
who you talk to. The city is full of the
meanest sort of converted rebels, who are
harder on us than the Yankees. If Mrs.
Martin goes out shopping or receives a guest
oftener than once a week, they run to the
marshal with the news, and I have the satisfaction
of knowing that my premises are being
watched for spies."</p>

<p>"They are a contemptible lot," declared
Dick. "And if the provost marshal was the
gentleman we took him for, he would not pay
the least heed to their reports."</p>

<p>"All's fair in war," said the host. "These
converted rebels are working for trade permits.
There's going to be a lot of money made in
cotton one of these days, and they want some of
it. While in the city you may listen all you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
please, but don't make a confidant of anybody
but me. And don't have too much to say to
those four escaped prisoners. You may run
across them some time when they are on
duty."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin talked for half an hour in this
strain, dropping hints here and there which
proved to be of great service to Rodney, and
then he conducted the boys to a clothing store
and left them to make their purchases, while
he went out to look for a team. Before they
went to bed that night their business was all
done, and all that remained for them to do in
the morning was to load the two-horse wagon
their host had provided for them and go home.
Mr. Martin obtained from Rodney a list of
needed goods, principally groceries, which he
purchased and packed himself; and when the
various boxes, barrels, and bags that comprised
his load were afterward unpacked at
his father's door, Rodney found in them many
little articles which he was sure he had not
placed on that list. They made an early
start, and Rodney's parting injunction to Mr.
Martin was to seek an interview with the mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
carrier at the earliest possible moment, for
Dick was impatient to be on his way home.</p>

<p>"This is my first work as an overseer," said
Rodney, when the city was left behind and
the two scraggy mules that pulled the wagon
had been coaxed and thrashed into a snail's
trot, "and I think I have made a very fair
beginning, seeing that the business is new to
me. My next task will be to see you over the
river."</p>

<p>"I never knew you were an overseer," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"I've called myself one ever since I had
that talk with my father on the night we came
home," answered Rodney. "And just see
what I shall have to do when you are gone!
I battled for fame and didn't get it, and now
I am going to work for dollars and see if I will
have any better luck. Dick, I am just aching
to make the acquaintance of one of those
traders&mdash;that is, a Yankee trader. Not one
of those converted rebels Mr. Martin told us
of shall touch a bale of our cotton, if I have to
fight to keep him away from it; but if some
good Yankee comes along and offers sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
cents a pound for it, you just wait and see
how hard I will work to put it in his
hands."</p>

<p>It was plain that Rodney Gray belonged to
the class who were denounced by Pollard, the
Southern historian, as "unpatriotic planters."
In writing of this very matter Mr. Pollard
said: "The country had taken a solemn resolution
to burn the cotton in advance of the
enemy; but the conflagration of this staple
became a rare event; instead of being committed
to the flames it was spirited away to
Yankee markets. The planters of the extreme
South, who prior to the war were loudest
for secession, were known to buy every article
of their consumption from the invading army.
Nor were these operations always disguised.
Some commercial houses in the Confederacy
counted their gains by millions of dollars
through the favor of the government in allowing
them to export cotton at pleasure." But
Rodney Gray was a private individual, and he
was well aware that if his father's cotton
brought the money it was really worth, it
would take some good scheming on his part.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span></p>

<p>About an hour after the boys left the city
they came upon the first picket post, which
they found to be an unusually strong one,
being composed of one sergeant, two corporals,
and eight or nine privates. Rodney had just
time to remark "We pass inspection here,
probably," when one of the soldiers walked
to the middle of the road, brought his musket
to "arms port" and commanded them to halt.
An instant afterward their wagon was surrounded
by the rest of the pickets, who shook
the barrels back and forth, dug their fingers
into the bags, and bumped the boxes about in
the most unceremonious style.</p>

<p>"Got a permit?" demanded the sergeant.
"And a pass?" He did not ask who the
boys were or where they came from, and the
sequel proved that he knew without asking.</p>

<p>"These documents appear to be all right,"
he continued, after he had read the papers
Rodney handed out. "Discharged rebels,
eh? You don't seem to be such a desperate
looking couple. What you got in your
wagon?"</p>

<p>"Munitions of war," replied Rodney.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
"There's a six-pound field-piece in one of
those barrels."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought. Get out, both of
you."</p>

<p>Although the boys were surprised and
startled by this unexpected command they
were prompt to obey it.</p>

<p>"Now let me see what you've got in your
pockets," said the sergeant. "Every scrap,
mind you."</p>

<p>"You're welcome to read all the letters and
things of that sort you can find about us,"
answered Rodney. "We are not simple
enough to lose our permits and passes by
carrying despatches the first thing."</p>

<p>"They're the laddie-bucks who helped
the &mdash;th Michigan's boys," observed a corporal.</p>

<p>"I know; but business is business," said
the sergeant. "And they've been in Martin's
company ever since they came to town."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I don't object to your
doing your duty, for I've been a soldier myself,"
said Rodney. "But I do object to
being taken for a plumb dunce. You'll find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
no writing about us except the papers we
showed you and our discharges."</p>

<p>But the sergeant obeyed orders, like the
good soldier he was, and it was not until he
had seen all their pockets turned inside out,
and had felt of the seams of their coats and
trousers, that he concluded they were all
right and could pass on. He did not say a
word about the things they had in the
wagon. He was after despatches and nothing
else.</p>

<p>"Climb in and go ahead, Johnny," said the
sergeant, giving Rodney a friendly slap to
help him along. "And when you see that
best girl of yours, give her my regards and
say that I am coming out to call on her one of
these days."</p>

<p>"Well, be sure and come in a crowd.
You'll see fun if you don't."</p>

<p>"Any graybacks out your way?"</p>

<p>"Some; and the events of the last few hours
will probably bring more. So-long, boys,
and look out for the rebs in Vicksburg. They
are coming down to clean you out."</p>

<p>He was answered by shouts of laughter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
derision from the Federals, who advised him
not to take a hand in the cleaning-out business,
for he would be whipped if he did. He
drove on, glad to escape so easily, and in due
time turned up at Mr. Turnbull's house, where
he and Dick rested the balance of the day and
slept that night. When it was dark a barrel
of flour was taken from the wagon and carried
into Mrs. Turnbull's dining room; and when
some of the flour had been taken out four bags
of salt were brought to light. If those little
bags had been filled with money Mr. Turnbull
and his wife could scarcely have expressed
more joy.</p>

<p>"We've been seasoning our food with the
floor of the smoke-house for the last two
months," said the former, "and I tell you I
am glad to see some clean salt once more.
You have made us your everlasting debtors.
How much did it cost you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't get an itemized bill," replied
Rodney. "Take it to pay for our grub and
lodging."</p>

<p>The next night saw them safe at home, and
the night following found them settled on Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Gray's upper plantation, which was located a
mile or two up the river from the one on which
Ned Griffin was living as overseer. Rodney
was elated over the result of his first visit
to the city, for the immediate wants of the
family had been abundantly supplied by that
wagon-load of goods, and he and Dick could
now wear clothes that looked as though they
fitted somewhere; but his father and mother
were not elated. They looked serious, and
Rodney told Dick that he made a mistake
when he described how carefully the
Federal soldiers searched them for despatches.</p>

<p>"And it is a bad thing for you that they
know we make our headquarters at Mr. Martin's,"
he added. "They've got an eye on
him; and what will you bet that they don't
know he sees that mail carrier once in a
while?"</p>

<p>"Then what's the reason they don't arrest
him and the mail carrier too?" said
Dick.</p>

<p>"They'll jump down on the pair of them
when they are good and ready, and think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
can capture some important documents by
doing it," answered Rodney. "You can't
cross at Baton Rouge. You'll have to start
from some point up the river. But we'll see
the mail carrier if we can, and hear what he
has to say about it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="small">CAPTAIN RANDOLPH RECEIVES ORDERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">Rodney Gray</span> was an overseer now at
all events, and being one of those uneasy
fellows who must have something to occupy
their minds at all times, and fond of hunting,
he would have been as happy and contented as
he wanted to be, if there had been no such
things as Home Guards in the world. The
Yankees at Baton Rouge he did not bother his
head about. He had charge of 400 acres of
land, 100 of which were under cultivation, and
fifteen work hands&mdash;just enough to bring him
under the exemption clause of the Conscription
Act. For the privilege of staying at home and
overseeing these hands the Confederate Government
demanded of him 3000 pounds of salt
pork and beef, or their equivalent in bacon,
and Rodney expected to furnish the meat himself.
There were many hogs running loose in
the woods, and as the negro driver who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
charge of the plantation previous to Rodney's
coming had taken no pains to "tame" them
by feeding them regularly, they were as wild
as deer, and Rodney intended to hunt them
as he would have hunted deer&mdash;"with rifle
and with hounds."</p>

<p>The "great house" in which Rodney lived
was very unlike the same dwelling on the
home plantation. It was built of unhewn logs
and contained two rooms, the wide hall between
them being used as the dining room,
both summer and winter. The kitchen, which
stood a little distance away, was built of logs,
and so were the negro cabins, corn-cribs,
smoke houses, and the little stable in which
his riding horse would find shelter in stormy
weather; but taken as it stood the plantation
was a valuable one, for, concealed somewhere
in the dark recesses of the woods, that hemmed
the cultivated fields in on all sides, were several
hundred bales of cotton that was worth
sixty cents a pound in Northern markets.</p>

<p>The driver had been so careless with his
work and so lax with the hands that Rodney
found plenty of things demanding his attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
but he could not think of settling down
to business so long as Dick remained with him.
When they parted it might be forever, and
Rodney was reluctant to let him go. Mr. Martin
told them that they need not come to the
city under a week expecting to hear any news
from the mail carrier, but they did not wait as
long as that without hearing news from another
source, and of the most exciting character
too. On the morning of the third day after
their arrival at the plantation, Dick looked
over Rodney's shoulder as they sat at the
breakfast table in the wide hall, and saw half
a dozen armed men ride up to the bars. They
stood there a minute or two looking up and
down the road, and then three of them dismounted
and came into the yard. At the same
instant another similar squad came in sight
and also rode up and stopped at the bars.</p>

<p>"Rebs for a dollar," whispered Dick.</p>

<p>"And not Home Guards, either," replied
Rodney, as the two arose from the table and
walked out to meet the visitors. "They are
strangers."</p>

<p>"Well," said the foremost, who might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
been an officer, though there was nothing on
his coat to show it, "how does it come that a
couple of likely lads like yourselves are here
in citizen's clothes while everybody else is in
the army?"</p>

<p>"Been there and came home to take a little
rest," answered Rodney, feeling in his pocket
for his discharge. "But everybody else isn't
in the army by a long shot, as you would
know if you belonged in this country. Read
that, and tell me if you are out conscripting."</p>

<p>"We're out for more serious business than
that," replied the soldier, reading the discharges
one after the other, and handing them
back to their owners. "Any Yanks about
here?"</p>

<p>"None nearer than Baton Rouge that we
know of."</p>

<p>"How large an army have they got there?"</p>

<p>The boys were obliged to say they couldn't
tell; but they knew that General Williams
had come down from Vicksburg with his whole
force.</p>

<p>"We know that, too, and are following him
up to lick him."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span></p>

<p>We don't know how to give an idea, in
words, of the exclamation that broke from
Dick Graham's lips when he heard this. It
was the famous "rebel yell," long, loud, and
piercing; and when the soldiers at the bars
heard it they turned in their saddles and lifted
their hats, and needed no other evidence to
prove that Dick was or had been one of themselves.
Then Dick demanded if there was
going to be a fight right there in his friend's
door-yard.</p>

<p>"It'll happen somewhere about here," replied
the soldier. "Better find guns, you
two, and join in. It's bound to be a victory for
our side and you want to share in the honor.
We're going to have the <i>Arkansas</i> to help
us, and she is a match for all the vessels the
Yanks have in the river. She proved it by
what she did up at Yazoo."</p>

<p>After a little more conversation the boys
learned that their visitor belonged to Breckenridge's
division, which had been detached from
the force at Vicksburg as soon as General
Williams withdrew and Farragut started down
the river, and they were simply scouting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
advance of the main body, which was to be
reinforced by all the conscripts and regular
troops at Camp Pinckney.</p>

<p>"If you want help, why don't you bring
into your ranks all the Home Guards around
here?" said Rodney.</p>

<p>"Are there Home Guards about here? I
am glad to know it, for we need all the help
we can raise. Who's their captain and where
are his headquarters?"</p>

<p>Rodney gave the desired information, adding
that if his visitor did not think it safe to
venture as far as Mooreville with the small
force at his command, he and Dick would volunteer
to take a message to Captain Randolph.
"But you will have to put it in writing," said
he, "for Tom will not believe us. And you
must caution him against letting his men
know that there is going to be a fight; for if
they find that out they'll scatter like rats in a
pantry."</p>

<p>"Like Home Guards everywhere," replied
the soldier in disgust. "I'll tell you what
I'll do," said he, after thinking a moment.
"I'll get a line from the colonel commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
our advance ordering Captain Randolph to
hold his company in readiness to march at a
moment's notice, and I'll either bring or send
it here to-night if you will deliver it. Of
course you'll not say anything to him or anybody
else that will get to the enemy's ears."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't think to surprise the
Yanks," exclaimed Dick. "They have had
notice already that you are coming. But we'll
get Tom out if we can."</p>

<p>The soldier asked a few more questions that
the boys could not answer satisfactorily touching
the length, shape, and strength of the
Federal lines at Baton Rouge, and then joined
his men, who moved down the road toward
Mooreville.</p>

<p>"Did you forget Captain Roach and his
conscripts?" asked Dick, when they were out
of sight.</p>

<p>"I left them out on purpose," said Rodney.
"But of course I shall speak to Roach about
it when we take that note to Tom Randolph.
His conscripts are all my near neighbors, and
mostly Union men, who wouldn't be of the
least use in a fight; and, Dick," here Rodney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
sunk his voice to a whisper, "if I can do it
without risk to myself, I shall go out of my
way to warn them of what's coming."</p>

<p>"Oh, you traitor!" cried Dick.</p>

<p>"You would do the same if you were in my
fix. Of course there are some I would not
dare speak to, for they would tell where they
got the information; but those I can trust to
keep a still tongue in their heads will be
warned, if I can find them."</p>

<p>The boys went back to their unfinished
breakfast and ate heartily, as they had often
done while men all around them were forming
in line of battle and shells were bursting over
their heads. But still Rodney was anxious,
for the coming contest might bring great loss
to his father. There were many bales of cotton
concealed within a circle of a few miles
of the place where he was sitting; both sides
had proclaimed it contraband of war, and it
seemed impossible that a line of battle could
go far in any direction without discovering
some of it; and the destruction of part would
lead to the destruction of the whole, for some
of those who lost, Mr. Randolph for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
would be mean enough to point out the hiding-place
of the rest. This reflection troubled
Rodney, but before he sat down to another
meal he had something besides cotton to think
about. The scouts of the opposing armies
came together down the road, out of sight,
but within plain hearing of the two boys, who
ran to the bars and listened to the sounds of
the conflict. They heard the sharp, quick
reports of the carbines, and the cheers and
yells of the combatants; and when the yells
became fainter and at last died away altogether,
and the cheers grew in volume until
they became one continuous cheer, they
looked at each other with the same startling
question in their eyes.</p>

<p>"That's the first encounter, and we're
whipped," said Dick. "Now if the victorious
Yanks come back this way&mdash;then
what?"</p>

<p>"Our discharges and passes and permits
will be of no more use than so much blank
paper," answered Rodney. "They'll say that
if we haven't given information of some sort
to the enemy already, we will do it the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
chance we get, and so we'd better trot right
along with them to Baton Rouge."</p>

<p>"That's what I am afraid of. I don't want
to go to Baton Rouge."</p>

<p>"Neither do I; and so I am going to do as
other and better men have done under similar
circumstances."</p>

<p>"Afoot or on horseback?" inquired Dick,
who knew that his friend had resolved to take
to the woods.</p>

<p>"On horseback, to save our animals from
being stolen, and to give color to the story
that we have gone to town," replied Rodney.
"Come on, for there's no telling how soon the
Yanks may come down the road at a gallop."</p>

<p>While one started for the stable yard, the
other ran in to tell his black housekeeper that
he was going to ride toward Mooreville, where
he would remain until the Federals had left
the country. Yes, there had been a sharp
skirmish down there in the woods, he said in
reply to the woman's anxious inquiries, the
Confederates had been driven from the field,
and he and Dick thought it best to get out of
sight for awhile.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p>"The Federals may not come back this
way," added Rodney, "but if they do, tell
the truth and don't try to pass me off for a
Union man. They know as well as you do
that I have served my time in the Confederate
army, and there's nothing to gain by telling a
different story. If anyone asks for me, you
can say that I have ridden toward Mooreville."</p>

<p>Well, he and Dick did ride toward Mooreville,
but they did not go there. Not knowing
how far the darkeys could be trusted,
they went down the road half a mile or so,
and turning into the woods hitched their
horses close together so that they would not
call to each other, and finally took up a position
from which they could see the house and
anybody who approached it. These precautions
were not taken any too soon, for the
Federals did scout back that way, and when
they came in sight they were riding at top
speed. They knew that a large party of horsemen
had passed along the road before them,
for they saw the prints of many hoofs in the
dust. Some of them kept on without drawing
rein, while others went into the house and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
over it; but as no contraband goods rewarded
their search they left it standing when they
went away. And although the hands all left
their work in the field and ran to the dwelling
when they saw the blue-coats surrounding it,
they did not improve the opportunity to secure
their freedom, as the boys thought they
would. They returned to their work when
the soldiers departed, and Rodney and Dick
thought it safe to go back to the house.</p>

<p>Their next visitor was a single Confederate
soldier, who arrived just at dusk with a note
addressed to "Captain Thomas Randolph,
C. S. A., Commdg. Mooreville Troops." This
man Rodney took into the house and fed as if
he had been a long-lost brother, for he was
anxious to learn something about the battle
that was soon to take place; but, although
the messenger said he was orderly at headquarters,
he could or would give very little
information. Breckenridge was rapidly feeling
his way toward the city, he said; he would
soon be reinforced by the command of General
Ruggles, which would be picked up at Camp
Pinckney, and with the <i>Arkansas</i> to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
and clean the Yankee gunboats out of the
river, there was no doubt but that a decisive
victory awaited him; and having finished his
supper, and said all he had to say, the messenger
mounted his horse and rode off. Five
minutes later Rodney and Dick had mounted
theirs and were riding hard to carry that note
to Captain Randolph. They stopped at Rodney's
home just long enough to put the folks
on nettles with the very meager information
they had to give, and a quarter of an hour
afterward were sitting in Mrs. Randolph's
parlor, waiting for Tom to show himself.
When he came he was accompanied by his
mother.</p>

<p>"Hallo, boys!" exclaimed Tom, with great
apparent cordiality, while Mrs. Randolph
shook hands with them one after the other.
"You don't know how I have longed to see
you both in order to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," interposed Rodney, who
knew there wasn't a word of truth in what
Tom had set out to say. "But if you will
excuse me&mdash;here is an order that I was requested
to place in your hands."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's got any right to order me
around?" exclaimed Tom, taking the note
and fixing his gaze upon the writing on the
outside. "'Captain Thomas Randolph,
C. S. A.,'" he read aloud. "Somebody has
made a big mistake, for I don't belong to the
army of the Confederate States, and never
did. What's in it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Rodney; while
Mrs. Randolph suggested that it might be a
good plan for him to open it and find out.
Tom did so with evident reluctance, and before
he had fairly had time to make himself
master of its contents, he turned as white
as a sheet and fell heavily into the nearest
chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear boy! What is the matter?
What could have disturbed you so?" cried
his mother, who was really alarmed.</p>

<p>"I'll not obey it!" shouted Captain Tom, as
soon as he could speak. "Who is this Colonel
Clark, who takes it upon himself to command
me to hold my company ready to move at a
moment's notice, and what does he want of
the company anyhow?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span></p>

<p>"No doubt he wants you to help&mdash;&mdash;"
began Rodney.</p>

<p>"But how does he know that there is such
a fellow as I am in the world, and that I command
a company of State troops?" continued
Tom, who was almost beside himself with
terror. Acting on his own responsibility and
serving under the eye of a Confederate officer
were two widely different things. His mother
took the note from his hand and read it, and
she, too, became visibly affected.</p>

<p>"What can be the meaning of it?" she
asked of Rodney.</p>

<p>"It means that there is going to be a
battle somewhere in this vicinity, and that
Tom must bring his men out to help," was
the reply. Rodney had predicted just such
a scene as this and was prepared to enjoy
it.</p>

<p>"A battle?" gasped Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in this vicinity!" echoed
Tom.</p>

<p>"That's what they tell me, and indeed
there has been a skirmish already. Breckenridge
is coming here to drive the Yankees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
out of Baton Rouge, and the <i>Arkansas</i> is
coming to assist him."</p>

<p>Tom and his mother were too amazed to
speak. They stared stupidly at the bearer of
these evil tidings, and listened in a dazed sort
of way while he told what he had heard and
seen since morning. There was one thing Tom
and his mother could not understand, and that
was how Colonel Clark, whoever he might be,
knew there was a company of Home Guards
at Mooreville and that Tom was commander
of them. But of course Rodney did not enlighten
them on that point.</p>

<p>"You enlisted for just such work as this,"
said he.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!" shouted Tom. "And
what's more, I won't go. I'm as close to the
Yankees as I want to be, and besides I don't belong
to the service any longer. I've resigned."</p>

<p>This was news to the boys, who could
scarcely refrain from showing how surprised
they were to hear it. They were disappointed
as well, for if Tom told the truth they would
lose the fun of hearing how he took to the
bushes to escape duty.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course if your resignation has been
accepted by the Governor," said Rodney,
"why, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It hasn't been accepted yet," replied Tom,
speaking before he thought. "I only sent it
to-day."</p>

<p>"Then you are still in the service and can be
held to duty," said Dick; and Captain Tom
and his mother both heard the sigh of satisfaction
that escaped him as he uttered the words.
"I have known men to go into action and be
killed after their term of service expired."</p>

<p>"But I won't do it, I bet you," whined
Tom, with tears in his eyes. "Do you think
it will be a very hard fight?"</p>

<p>"It can't help it; it's bound to be, and
you'll see more dead and wounded men lying
around than you&mdash;&mdash; Gracious! I'm glad
they can't call on you and me, Dick."</p>

<p>"Why, won't you have to go?" faltered
Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. We showed our discharges
to-day, and they never said a word about
ordering us out. They can't, for we have
served our time."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p>

<p>This was the heaviest blow yet, and Captain
Tom came so near wilting under it that Rodney's
heart smote him and he determined to
take his leave. So he got upon his feet, and
Dick followed his example.</p>

<p>"What will they do to Tom if he fails to
obey this order?" asked Mrs. Randolph, who,
in all the trying ordeals through which she
had passed on her cowardly son's account,
had never before been so badly frightened.</p>

<p>"I couldn't obey it if I wanted to," cried
Tom. "My men are scattered for miles
through the country, and I couldn't spend
the night in hunting them up."</p>

<p>"They may call it disobedience of orders if
you don't do it," replied Rodney, who wanted
to laugh. "If I were in your place I would
make the effort."</p>

<p>"And run the risk of being shot? But
suppose my men refuse to turn out?" said
Tom, a bright idea coming into his mind.</p>

<p>"Then you will be blameless, and all you
have to do will be to report to the colonel and
tell him that you are ready for any duty he
may assign you."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span></p>

<p>"And can't I stay at home any way I can
fix it?" inquired Tom, who made no effort to
conceal his terror.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't. What if some of the colonel's
troopers should find you skulking here when
you ought to be in the front rank? Or suppose
the battle should be fought on your
plantation. Wouldn't you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baton Rouge is not on our plantation."</p>

<p>"I know, but a battle sometimes ends a
good many miles from where it begins, and
the one that's coming is as likely to be fought
here as anywhere else. And if that should
happen, wouldn't you rather have a musket
in your hands than go skulking through the
bushes trying to keep out of danger? I would
a hundred times over. But really we must be
going. Good-night."</p>

<p>Rodney and his companion bowed themselves
to the door and went out, and Captain
Tom and his mother sat in their chairs looking
at each other and listening to the clatter of
the receding hoofs. When it died away
altogether Tom jumped to his feet in great
excitement.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>

<p>"We never once thought to ask them
where they got that order, or why it was sent
by their hands instead of by the hands of one
of that colonel's own men," he fairly sputtered.
"Mother, it's an infamous trick, and
there isn't going to be any fight. I'll remember
Rodney Gray for this and other things he
has done to me&mdash;you see if I don't!"</p>

<p>"I hope you are duly ashamed of yourself
for frightening that poor woman so terribly,"
said Dick, as he and Rodney galloped out of
the yard and turned their horses toward the
village.</p>

<p>"Why didn't she stay out of the room?"
retorted Rodney. "We sent in word that we
desired to see Captain Tom privately, but she
didn't take the hint. So Tom thought he
couldn't spend the night in riding about the
country. Well, we've got to, if we do the
work we set out to do."</p>

<p>The first part of that work was to call upon
Captain Roach, who had excited Tom Randolph's
ire by accepting Rodney's invitation
to dinner, and the next to warn some of the
Union men whom he had conscripted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
former was overwhelmed with surprise and
didn't know what to do, not being a veteran;
but he wasn't a coward, if he did turn white.
He talked the matter over very calmly with
his visitors, and following their advice said he
would drop the conscript business until the
battle had been decided one way or the other.
And then he looked helplessly at Rodney as
if to ask what he should do next.</p>

<p>"You ought to do duty or shed that uniform,"
said the boy bluntly. "You can't
assemble your conscripts now, and if you
could, where would you find men to guard
them to Camp Pinckney? You can only show
your good-will by reporting at the camp; and
if I were in your place, I think I should start
the first thing in the morning. If you delay,
you will be liable to be cut off by Federal
scouting parties. Have you seen any Yanks
about here to-day?"</p>

<p>Captain Roach replied that he hadn't seen
or heard of any, and Rodney went on to tell
about the skirmish that had taken place near
his plantation, and how he and Dick had
taken to the woods and escaped being caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
in the house. The Federals couldn't prove
anything against them, he said, but they could
shut them up in Baton Rouge until Breckenridge
captured it or was driven back where he
came from, and that was something he didn't
want them to do. Then he and Dick shook
hands with the enrolling officer, wished him
good luck, and went out into the night to
finish their work. It kept them busy until
daylight, and then they went to Mr. Gray's to
breakfast, happy in the knowledge that they
had done as they would be done by, and not
one who wished them harm was the wiser
for it.</p>

<p>Tom Randolph was hardly out of bed the
next morning before he was made aware
that there was some truth in Rodney Gray's
story. A squad of Federal cavalry went by
the house on a keen jump, and about an hour
behind them a larger squad of Confederates
went past at the same rapid gait. Tom wasn't
soldier enough to know that these were nothing
but scouts, and in his ignorance supposed
that the battle had been fought while he was
asleep, and that the Confederates had driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
their antagonists; but it was not long before
he discovered that the worst was yet to come.
All that day soldiers in gray uniforms were
in sight somewhere. They streamed by the
house or came into the yard and gathered
about the well, and an officer with high top-boots
and a fierce mustache stood on the front
gallery and issued orders in a voice that
sounded as loud as a fog-horn. They trampled
down the flower beds, cleared the cellar of
everything eatable, and helped themselves to
what there was in the kitchen, and through
it all, the captain of the Home Guards never
showed himself. Some of the time he was in
the garret, oftener he was under the bed in his
mother's room, and then again his frightened
eyes were peeping through the carefully closed
blinds. He had never dreamed that there
were so many men in an army, and yet he saw
but one column of a very small army, for
Breckenridge made his assault with less than
4000 men. To his immense relief no one asked
for him, and perhaps the reason was because
Colonel Clark, who wrote that order, was with
the other column, five or six miles away.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span></p>

<p>The attack on Baton Rouge was made the
next morning at daylight, and although Rodney
and Dick heard little of it and saw less,
they had some hospital work on their hands.
The heat was intense, and everywhere along
the line of march men fell exhausted out of the
ranks, and were taken in and cared for by the
planters. Rodney's house and door-yard were
filled with soldiers who could not go any
farther toward the enemy, although they recovered
their strength and power of action
very suddenly when it became known that
there was a possibility of the enemy's cavalry
coming toward them. The attack, which was
so successful at first that the Federal camps
were captured or burned, failed utterly in the
end, and at noon the fight was over and the
Confederates were in full retreat. The <i>Arkansas</i>
did not come down to help with her big
guns, and if she had she might have met a
warmer reception than she bargained for, for
there were five gunboats in the river, including
the iron-clad <i>Essex</i>. These took an earnest
part in the fight while waiting for the <i>Arkansas</i>,
their fire being directed by an army signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
officer who stood on the roof of the capitol
building. The Confederates were so badly
whipped that they left seventy men on the
field for the Union forces to bury.</p>

<p>The closing scene of the fight was enacted
the next morning. The <i>Essex</i> went up the
river six miles, found the terrible <i>Arkansas</i>,
with her ten heavy guns and 180 picked men,
hard and fast aground, and pounded her so
severely that in fifteen minutes she was set on
fire and abandoned. She blew up when the
fire reached her magazine, but she left others
behind which made themselves known and
feared before the war was over.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="small">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="caps"><span class="upper">This</span> short visit of the Confederate army
was like a plague of locusts; everything
in the shape of eatables in and around Mooreville
that they could place their hands on disappeared
and was never heard of afterward.
Some articles of value disappeared likewise, as
was to have been expected; but not very many,
for the settlers had learned that it was best to
be careful of such things during war times.
No one had seen a Home Guard during those
two troublous days, nobody could tell where
Captain Randolph had kept himself or how he
had behaved, and neither was there any news
to be had of Captain Roach.</p>

<p>Our two friends drew a long breath of relief
when "the fuss" was over, congratulated
themselves on having escaped both duty and
suspicion, and waited with what patience they
could for the excitement to pass away so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
it would be safe for them to go into the city.
But that time seemed long in coming. Inquisitive
Federal scouts, who asked troublesome
questions and insisted on knowing all
about everything, came to the house every
day, and on three occasions wounded Confederate
stragglers appealed to their pity and
begged assistance. Nor were these appeals
made in vain, though the boys took great
risks in concealing their Confederate friends
during the day and helping them on their
road at night. They deceived their neighbors,
hoodwinked the darkeys they were afraid to
trust, and told gauzy stories to Federal scouts
until Dick affirmed that deceiving and lying
would become a confirmed habit with them.
But fortunately the necessity for these things
passed away before that happened. The
country was cleared of stragglers after a while,
the settlement quieted down, and Rodney and
Dick were ready for the next thing on the
programme.</p>

<p>"I don't know when I have had so hard a
task set before me," said Rodney, "and I
would be glad to put it off forever if I could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
But since the parting must come, it might as
well be one time as another. Shall we start
for the city to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>Dick answered with a decided affirmative,
and the start was made. Believing that he
ought to be ready to act as soon as the opportunity
was presented, he took leave of Rodney's
father and mother as though he never
expected to see them again, and Rodney drew
on the family purse for a good many gold
pieces. If Dick succeeded in getting across
the river he would still have a long journey
before him&mdash;longer than the one Rodney made
from Cedar Bluff landing to Price's army&mdash;and
he would need a horse to ride, a coat and
blanket to cover him when he camped at night,
and money to purchase his supplies; and his
friend's forethought provided for all these
necessary things.</p>

<p>On their way to Baton Rouge they passed
over the ground on which the right wing of
the Confederate force formed in line of battle
previous to the assault. It was just beyond
Mr. Turnbull's house; and that gentleman's
wife, after giving a glowing description of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
gallant way in which the Confederates advanced
to the attack, told the boys in a
confidential whisper that she had aided two
Yankees who were captured and managed to
escape during the fight; that there was a
wounded rebel in one of the upper rooms of
her house at that moment; that he was going
to remain there until he was able to travel;
and that one of the escaped prisoners whom
Rodney befriended had smuggled medicine
through the lines for him at her request, thus
proving that there was such a thing as gratitude
in the world. Before the boys left the
house, they visited the wounded rebel in his
room, and he told them that the fight was the
most savagely contested of any he had ever
been in, and, for the number of men engaged,
the bloodiest. Some of the Indiana and
Michigan boys fought with rails which they
snatched from the fences, and the Yank who
smuggled the medicine out for him said he
had counted thirteen dead rebs in one heap.</p>

<p>"It was bad for our side," moaned the
wounded soldier, "and even if the <i>Arkansas</i>
had been there to help us I don't suppose we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
would have made any better showing. The
Yanks had things fixed for us, and now I've
got to hobble through the world on one leg."</p>

<p>Although some stray missiles from the Confederate
side found their way into the streets
of the city, the boys did not find there as
many signs of the conflict as they expected
to see. Mr. Martin's buildings escaped unscathed,
but Mr. Martin himself had been
placed in arrest to prevent him from holding
any communication with the enemy.</p>

<p>"As if I ever dreamed of doing such a foolish
thing!" said he contemptuously. "Why,
I want to live here; and consequently I do
nothing that I consider to be risky. But I
have seen the mail carrier, and he is going to
pick up some bags this very night."</p>

<p>"Pick them up!" repeated Rodney.
"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Out in the country somewhere, and he is
out there too, or will be at eight o'clock;
and if your friend wants to go, now's his
chance."</p>

<p>"Mr. Martin, I hope your kind efforts in my
behalf will not bring you into trouble with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Yanks," said Dick. "I feel very grateful to
you."</p>

<p>But he didn't look so, and neither did Rodney.
The time when they must part was close
at hand.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurry you away," continued
Mr. Martin, "but as it will take some
little time to ride to the place to which I shall
direct you, you had better have your horses
out of the stable at five o'clock, so as to pass
the pickets before dark. I will give you a
letter that will make you all right with
Henderson."</p>

<p>The rest of the day, to quote from Dick
Graham, flew away as if the hours had been
greased. Half-past four came before they
knew it, and with it the letter their host had
promised them, accompanied by some instructions
which they must closely follow in order
to find and obtain an interview with Henderson.
He was a cross, crabbed old fellow, Mr.
Martin said, but the boys mustn't mind that.
They would be cross and suspicious too, if
they had been bothered and balked in their
business as Henderson had been followed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
harassed in his. They must try and get on
the right side of him, for he could take Dick
to the other side if anybody could. Mr. Martin
excused himself for not accompanying
them to the stable where they left their horses
by saying that to be seen walking the streets
with a suspected man would bring suspicion
upon them, and that was one thing they
wanted to avoid.</p>

<p>The boys left the city and the pickets behind
in good season, and took pains to make some
noise as they galloped past the houses of
three "converted rebels" who, so Mr. Martin
said, were always watching and scheming for
a chance to report somebody. They rode as if
they were going home; but when darkness
came they doubled upon their trail, passed
these same houses again in silence, and turned
into a lane that took them miles up the river
to the hiding-place of Henderson, the mail
carrier. They found it to be a pretentious
plantation house situated in plain view of the
river, and not at all such a spot as they would
have chosen had they been engaged in Henderson's
business. It would have been impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
to surprise the mail carrier in his hiding-place,
however, as they found when they approached
nearer to it, for they had barely time to shout
out the customary "Hallo, the house! Don't
let your dogs bite!" before their horses were
surrounded by a pack of belligerent canines,
whose angry yelping completely drowned the
voice of the master of the house.</p>

<p>"Get out!" he shouted, as soon as he could
make himself heard above the tumult. "Who
is it, and what's wanted?"</p>

<p>"Friends from the city," replied Rodney,
who had been told just what to say. "I have
a communication for Mr. Henderson from our
mutual friend Mr. Martin. Will you look at
it?"</p>

<p>The planter came down to the gate, took the
letter from Rodney's hand, looking sharply at
him and Dick as he did so, and carried it into
the house with him. He did not ask them to
"alight and hitch," and that proved that
there was something or somebody in the
house he did not want the boys to see. It
was all of ten minutes before he came out
again, and he brought with him a companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
who straightway made himself known by saying,
in a complaining voice:</p>

<p>"I told Martin I couldn't do the like, and
here he's gone and sent you, just as if I had
agreed to do it. Which one of you is the
fool?"</p>

<p>"I am the one who wants to go over
the river, if you will be kind enough to
let me have a seat in your boat," replied
Dick.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about a boat?" demanded
Mr. Henderson, for the boys were
sure it was he. "Do you want to be captured
by the gunboats, and sent up for a spy or something?
I don't expect to get back alive, or
get across, either. But then! Martin's a friend
of mine and keeps me posted in some things
I&mdash;&mdash; Get off, both of you. Hitch your
horses somewhere and wait till I come."</p>

<p>"Dick, you're as good as off at last," whispered
Rodney, as the two men turned about
and went back to the house. "Think of me
riding all the way to Mr. Turnbull's alone in
the dark while you are running the risk of
being overhauled by the naval picket boats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Have you got your money and discharge all
right? Write to me if you see the ghost of a
chance for a letter to get through, for I shall
be anxious to hear from my old Barrington
chum."</p>

<p>The boys had plenty to say to each other
and an abundance of time to say it in, for a
whole hour passed before the mail carrier
again came out. This time he had two men
with him&mdash;the planter and another passenger,
the latter being muffled up to the eyes so that
no one could have seen his face if it had been
broad daylight. He said not a word, but the
mail carrier did, and Rodney was gratified to
notice that he was as careful to conceal Dick's
identity as he was that of his other passenger.</p>

<p>"Come on, you Moses," said he, "and remember
that you are deaf, dumb, and blind.
You, Jonas, get on your horse and clear yourself."</p>

<p>It would have done no good to prolong the
leave-taking, and Rodney was glad to have it
broken off so abruptly. He gave his friend's
hand a final squeeze and shake, and when he
came into the road again a moment later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
riding one horse and leading the other, there
was no one in sight.</p>

<p>The way home was a long and lonely one to
Rodney Gray, who felt as if the last tie that
bound him to his school days had been sundered
forever. He got through without any
trouble, although he met some inquisitive
people who wanted to know how he happened
to have a riderless horse with him, passed one
night at his father's house, and in due time
was back in his old quarters on the upper
plantation, where he had spent so many pleasant
hours with the absent Dick. But before
he had leisure to look about and tell himself
how very lonesome he was, he had visitors,
one of whom threw him into a terrible state of
mind before he left. They were a squad of
the &mdash;th Michigan boys, and commanded by
the corporal who had once taken him prisoner,
and whose name he had never heard. They
good-naturedly demanded all the weapons he
had, and threatened to go through his house
if he didn't trot them right out; but when
they went to the well for water the corporal
drew off on one side, intimating by a look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
that he had something to say to Rodney in
private.</p>

<p>"Where's your partner?" were the first
words he said when they were alone.</p>

<p>"Gone over the river," answered Rodney.</p>

<p>"How long since?"</p>

<p>"He went night before last."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll bet you a hard-tack he didn't
make it. Some of your good friends were the
means of stopping him. You see," he went
on, without giving the astonished Rodney time
to speak, "Ben and another boy, who were
in my party when you and Griffin did so much
for us, scouted down Randolph's way a few
days after the fight, and that Home Guard&mdash;&mdash;You
made a big blunder when you stuck to
us till we let him go. Now he's gone back on
you."</p>

<p>"What has he done?" inquired Rodney,
who told himself that that was just what he
expected from Tom Randolph.</p>

<p>"Why, Ben distinctly heard him tell one of
our officers that a bearer of despatches would
go from Mooreville in a few days, intending to
cross the river at Baton Rouge, where he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
friends to help him," said the corporal. "Of
course the matter was reported at headquarters,
and the houses of all the Secession sympathizers
in the city were watched closer than
ever."</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Martin's house watched, do you
know?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. He is always watched,
and we had him under arrest during the fight."</p>

<p>"And I was simple enough to tell the provost
marshal that that house would be my
stopping-place as often as I came to the city,"
groaned Rodney.</p>

<p>"You needn't blame yourself for that, for
I don't suppose it made a particle of difference,"
said the corporal soothingly. "The
provost marshal would have found it out
sooner or later, because it is a part of his business
to find out where every stranger lives, and
what he does while inside the lines. If you
went there with your friend Graham&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did," whispered Rodney. "And we
went from there up to&mdash;up to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Henderson's? Well, he's watched, too;
and if one is caught the other will be."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span></p>

<p>"If Tom Randolph has got Dick Graham
into trouble I will see that he is well punished
for it," said Rodney angrily.</p>

<p>"If he hasn't, it isn't because he didn't
try. If you say the word, I will go straight to
his house and arrest him for a Home Guard."</p>

<p>"No, no; don't do that. I am not coward
enough to take revenge on him in that way.
But since he has made his boast that he is
willing to die for the South, I will see that he
has all the chance he wants."</p>

<p>"Well, my boys seem to have had their fill
of water, so we'll jog along," said the corporal.
"If the Home Guards bother you let
us know, and we'll clean them out to the last
man. Good-by."</p>

<p>Astonished at the extent of the corporal's
information, and wondering how it was possible
for any Southern sympathizer to live in
Baton Rouge when he knew that he was so
closely watched, Rodney went into the house
as soon as the soldiers rode away, and sat
down to write a letter. As a general thing his
thoughts came rapidly and it was no trouble
for him to put them on paper; but this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
letter seemed to bother him, for he
made three copies of it before he got it to suit
him. Then he ordered his horse brought to
the door, changed his working clothes for a
business suit, and galloped off in the direction
of Mooreville. He stopped at his home "just
long enough to let his mother see that he was
all right" and then rode on again, but not
toward Mooreville or the river. There was no
one at either place whom he wanted to see
that day, but he did want to have a few
earnest words with General Ruggles, if he
could find him. During the fight the general
commanded the Confederate column that came
from Camp Pinckney, and there was where
Rodney hoped to find him now. Before he
had ridden a dozen miles into the country he
ran into a small party of rebels, who looked at
his discharge, and encouraged him by saying
that the officer he desired to see commanded
the camp, and was recruiting men as rapidly
as he could for some special service that was
to be performed up about Holly Springs.</p>

<p>"I know by experience that special service
usually means dangerous service," thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Rodney, as he rode on his way. "If Tom
Randolph really wants to do something for
the South, he will jump at the chance of going
to Holly Springs."</p>

<p>Camp Pinckney looked just as it did when
he and Dick Graham ran the guard there on
their way home, only there were more men
who were being made into soldiers, and the
number was being increased every day by the
disconsolate and homesick conscripts who
were sent there from all the districts in that
part of the State. Rodney was shown at once
into the presence of the commander, and knew,
before he had exchanged a dozen words with
him, that he would have no use for the letter
he had taken so much pains to write.</p>

<p>"I can attend to the business myself without
any aid from the Governor," said General
Ruggles, who looked more like a hard-working
farmer than he did like a brave and skilful
soldier. "The slip-shod manner in which
recruiting has been done in this district is
enough to make one forget the third commandment.
There hasn't been a single man sent to
this camp from your neighborhood."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span></p>

<p>"I am aware of it, sir. But as these men
belong to the State and not to the Confederacy,
I thought perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's no need of it, sir," interrupted
the general. "I have all the authority I want,
and can do the business without saying a word
to the Governor. Sent in his resignation, has
he? Captain&mdash;Thomas&mdash;Randolph," he continued,
writing the name on a slip of paper.
"And it has not yet been accepted? And
how many men do you think he has in his
company? All right. You go home and say
nothing to anybody, and I will put him where
he will meet something besides unarmed men
and women and children."</p>

<p>His business having been transacted to his
entire satisfaction, Rodney was in no particular
haste to go home. He made friends with one
of the veterans who composed the camp guard,
ate supper with him, and slept under half his
blanket that night; but the morning's sun
saw him well on his return journey. He made
a wide circuit to avoid passing through Mooreville,
and did not go near his father's house
for fear it might be remembered against him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
some future time. He went home as rapidly
as he could go, unsaddled his horse and
turned him into the stable-yard, and went into
the house; and there, seated in Rodney's
favorite rocking chair, with his feet upon the
back of another and a book in his hand, was&mdash;Dick
Graham.</p>

<p>"You've got cheek! Why didn't you come
out when you heard me at the bars?" exclaimed
Rodney, as soon as he found his
tongue.</p>

<p>"Because I thought you would prefer to
come in and find me," replied Dick; and then
he dropped his book and jumped to his feet,
and the two embraced each other schoolboy
fashion.</p>

<p>"O Dick, you don't know how I have worried
about you," said Rodney. "And Tom
Randolph was at the bottom of it all. You
would have been watched if he hadn't said a
word; but what I mean is that he made matters
worse. I have paid him for it, however.
Now tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"We didn't succeed, and that's all there is
to tell," answered Dick. "We made six attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
on two different nights, and once got
so near to the other shore that I was sure we
would make it; but the picket boats from the
fleet showed up, and we had to dig out. They
were on hand every time, and you ought to
have heard Henderson cuss. He declared that
one or the other of his passengers was a Jonah,
and he had a notion to chuck us both overboard
so as to be sure he got the right one."</p>

<p>"It was you, Dick. Who was the other
passenger?"</p>

<p>"I don't know any more about him now
than I did when I first saw him. When we
gave up trying on the first night and went
back to the house, he shut himself in his
room, and I never saw him till we went out on
the second night to try it over again. No
doubt he was a high-up officer with important
papers in his pockets."</p>

<p>"Of course the picket boats opened fire on
you."</p>

<p>"Of course they didn't, for we saw or heard
them in time to dodge out of their way. One
of them passed so close to us that we could
see, dark as it was, that she pulled six oars on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
a side. If she'd seen us or heard us breathe,
she would have had us sure."</p>

<p>"Go on. What did you do on the night I
left you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. We walked about a mile to
where a little bay made into the bank from
the river, and there we found a skiff with piles
of something in the bow and stern that I took
to be the precious mail-bags which Mr. Martin
said Henderson was going to pick up. When
we got in there was barely room for Henderson
to work the oars, and I didn't wonder that
he growled so about taking me over."</p>

<p>"How did you come home?"</p>

<p>"Well, when we came back after making
the sixth attempt, and Henderson got mad
and told me to clear out and never let him put
eyes on me again (I noticed that he didn't say
a word to the other fellow, and that's what
makes me think that he was an officer whom
Henderson had to take whether he wanted to
or not), I took him at his word and put for
Mr. Turnbull's. That gentleman was kind
enough to hitch up a team and take me to
your father's, and your father brought me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
here, to find you gone. You've been gone
three nights, and I want to know what you
mean by such work."</p>

<p>"I've been to Camp Pinckney to make
arrangements for Tom Randolph and his
Home Guards to go into the army," replied
Rodney, adding that he had written to the
Governor, laying the blame for the bombardment
of Baton Rouge upon the shoulders of
the Home Guards, and giving such other incidents
in their history as he thought would
attract the attention of the authorities and
induce them to do something; but General
Ruggles had promised to attend to the matter
himself.</p>

<p>"Of course Captain Randolph will be very
much obliged to you when he hears of it,"
observed Dick.</p>

<p>"He has nobody to thank but himself, and
since I have heard what those escaped prisoners
had to say about Home Guards, I wish
every one of them could be forced into the
army. Now you've got to stay with me until
the war is ended one way or the other, haven't
you?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span></p>

<p>"Not much. I'm going up to Port Hudson
to try it again, if you will show me the way;
and you ought to have heard Henderson rip
and snort because I didn't go there in the first
place without troubling him. But you see I
didn't know that I could, and you didn't
either. If I can take a boat from Port Hudson
up Red River to Alexandria, or better yet, up
Black River to Monroe, I shall save miles of
horseback travel."</p>

<p>"And run the risk of being captured by
gunboats every step of the way," added Rodney.
"But I suppose I'll have to go."</p>

<p>And he did the very next morning. This
time there was no trouble about it, for when
the steamer <i>New Era</i>, which was regularly
employed in bringing army supplies from the
Red River country, moved out from her landing
at Port Hudson bound for Monroe, she
carried Dick Graham with her. The night
was as dark as a pocket, but the lonely Rodney
kept watch on the bank as long as a
single spark could be seen coming out of her
smokestacks, and even lingered about the
place for two or three days, almost hoping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
that some Union gunboat would send a shot
across her bows and drive her back; but when
the soldiers assured him that she must have
gone through safely or else she would have returned
within a few hours of her departure,
he realized that the long delayed separation
had come at last, and turned his face sorrowfully
homeward.</p>

<p>He went directly to his father's house to
report the success of his undertaking, and
learned that Mooreville had been thrown into
a state of great excitement during his absence.
No one had seen or heard of Captain Roach
since Breckenridge made his fruitless attempt
to take the city, but his office was occupied
by a grizzly veteran, who hardly gave himself
time to sit down in Captain Roach's chair before
declaring that he hadn't come there to
stand nonsense from anybody, and that everyone
liable to military duty, Home Guards and
all, must make tracks for Camp Pinckney
or be dragged there by the neck. It didn't
make the least difference to him how they
went, but they must go; they might be sure
of that. He brought fifty veterans with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
to back him up, and in less than twenty-four
hours after taking possession of the office,
sent off forty-five conscripts, two-thirds of
whom were Home Guards.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Randolph tried the same game with
Major Morgan, that's the new man's name,
that she tried with so much success with Captain
Roach," said Mr. Gray with a laugh.
"But it didn't work. The major sent back
word that he had no time to go about visiting
and eating dinners, and Tom was given his
choice between reporting at the camp voluntarily
or being sent there under guard. It's
the best thing that was ever done for this
community."</p>

<p>Rodney wanted to shout, but instead of
doing that he got on his horse and rode
down to call on Major Morgan. He didn't
find the office filled with loafers, as it had
been in Captain Roach's time, but there
were a few bronzed fellows standing about
who remembered seeing Rodney at the
camp, and bowed to him as he came in.
The major remembered him too, and said,
as he gave the boy's hand one short, quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
jerk, that was doubtless intended for a
shake:</p>

<p>"There's material enough here to form the
finest kind of a battalion. Why don't you
apply for a commission and go out with it?
You've had rest enough by this time."</p>

<p>"Because I don't wish to command conscripts,"
replied Rodney, ignoring the fact that
half the soldiers in the Confederate armies
were conscripts and nothing else, being held
to service against their will. "Besides, I am
an overseer now, and I like it better than
fighting."</p>

<p>But Rodney could not keep out of trouble
as easily as he kept out of the army, nor did
Major Morgan succeed in sending all Tom
Randolph's Home Guards to Camp Pinckney.
Some of them, Lieutenants Lambert and Moseley
among the rest, took to the woods, and became
freebooters to all intents and purposes.
Whether these worthies knew or suspected
that he had a hand in the breaking up of
their organization Rodney never learned; but
he was quickly made aware that they did not
intend he should see a moment's peace if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
could help it. They either found the cotton
of which we have spoken, or else somebody
put them on the track of it; and the efforts
they made to destroy it, as well as the counter
efforts made by Rodney Gray and his two
Union cousins to protect it, shall be described
in the concluding volume of this series, which
will be entitled "<span class="smcap">Sailor Jack, the Trader</span>."</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
